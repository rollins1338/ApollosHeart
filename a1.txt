"If you have some spare time today, we should have lunch together. With Yuri as well." He casually suggested.

"That sounds like a plan." Si-yeon agreed excitedly. "Yuri, are you free?"



"I appreciate it, but.."

She was decisively cut mid-sentence.

"I would like to discuss purchase plans over the table."

As Roy Jean's assistant, discussing sales with a possible client on a lunch table was a suggestion Yuri could not easily reject.

Reluctantly, Yuri answered. "Ok. Thank you."

At that moment, the ghost of a smile appeared on Samuel's face.

"Seems like lunch works for Yuri as well."

Si-yeon's secretary, taking the cue, pulled out her cell phone and asked, "I will make a reservation immediately. Director Seo, what would you like?"

"I don't care. You can decide."

Secretary Kim reserved a table at the most popular French restaurant in the mall. The chef had a reputation he gained from his exceptional stint at a two-star Michelin restaurant in France and a hotel as well. Usually reservations needed to be at least a day in advance, but such trivialities did not apply if it was Si-yeon who was calling.



On the way to the restaurant, Yuri's mind delved into her possible relationship with Samuel  in the past.








What was their relationship? How did they know each other?

Associating her dreams to what was in front of her, she presumed it to be something very private and close to the heart. Close enough to warrant sexual and physical intimacy with one another.

But that assumption was only until the moment she realized he was an executive director of Seoin Group.

His identity and social position threw Si-yeon into the crossfire.

Even though she could not recall what happened in her past, in general, it was difficult to draw a connection between an art student with an unimpressive and underprivileged background and a person of the upper echelons of society.

Even when they sat down on the table and opened a menu, Yuri's mind was preoccupied with a snaggle of confusion.

Sitting next to Samuel , who sat across Yuri, Si-yeon stared into

Yuri's face.

"Are you okay, Yuri? You don't look well." She remarked.

"Huh?" Yuri raised her head and blanched, as she caught Samuel's eyes. Was he staring at her the whole time?

"I am all right, just a bit dizzy, but that's not new. It happens sometimes. Thank you for asking." She laughed sheepishly.

Yuri turned her mouth up slightly to be polite. Even then, like a ferocious beast preparing to hunt its prey, Samuel  still did not take his eyes off of her. Enduring his piercing gaze, Yuri reached to the water glass to ease her dry mouth.

As if waiting for an opportune moment, Samuel  finally spoke once more.








"Yuri, how long have you been working as an assistant to Mr. Jean?"

"It's been three years already." She replied softly.

"Three years." Samuel  tapped his long fingers on the table.

A big, strong hand - the hand that opened and caused Yuri's body to shake in her memories. She knew that hand too well. It was the very hand that she's seen in her dreams, leaving burning sensations on her skin.















"I did a little research on Roy Jean's career and found out he fell into a slump for quite some time after his wife's passing. And he happened to reinitiate his work three years ago." Samuel  looked squarely at Yuri as he spoke.

"Excuse me, but I don't understand what you're trying to say."

Indeed Yuri had no idea what this man was insinuating and where the conversation was headed towards. Her senses were on high alert, nonetheless.

"What are assistants usually responsible for?"

"We assist with the creation of work, or whatever needed." She replied plainly.

"Does it include something personal and private? For example, if he needs someone in his bed."

"Samuel !" Si-yeon exclaimed indignantly, slamming her water glass back on the table at his audacity to suggest such a thing, and shot him a scathing look. "You are being rude. That's such an indelicate question to ask."

He did not reply to Si-yeon, in fact, he ignored her as if she did not exist. Right now, Yuri was the only person worth laying his eyes upon. His eyes were prodding her to offer an answer. His eyes roamed all over her. His glances were burning, cold and passionate at the same time.



Yuri could sense one thing - whatever relationship they had in the past; it definitely did not end well. Samuel  did not try to veil his curious glances towards Yuri in front of his own fiancé. He did not even care if anyone saw him.







The question itself did not surprise Yuri. Roy Jean had a reputation for not hiring a female assistant in the industry.

After he'd separated from his wife by death at a young age, he had pursued his own celibacy for a long time, mourning for his loss. In order to avoid any kind of rumors involving women, he was reluctant to hire any female assistant.

When Yuri was hired as an assistant to Roy Jean as the first female assistant in over ten years, naturally, they became a hot topic for gossip. As a result, she had to repeat the same answer over and over again like a parrot.

"Mr. Jean and I do not share such a personal and intimate relationship. He is simply my boss and teacher."

"A boss and a teacher. I apologize. I was ignorant." Despite the apology, his tone suggested otherwise.

Thankfully, the lunch was served cutting off further conversation. The star chef appeared in front of them as if on a cooking show, explaining the menu of the day next to the table.

House-made cheese, top graded beef, and abalones freshly delivered from the seaside every morning could not impress Yuri. She could not even taste anything, and it seemed so with the man seated before her as well. He looked like he would rather cut, chew, and swallow Yuri than the food.



To cut the tension in the air, Si-yeon started speaking.

"Yuri, other than assisting Roy Jean, do you work on your personal pieces?"

Yuri was thankful for the change in topic. "For the moment, I don't have anything that I am working on my own."






"Why? Actually, the agency told me that there was a piece that inspired the Heart of Apollo, and I heard it was created by you. I was dying to see it, but it was not open to the public."

At that instant, Yuri dropped her fork.

Clink!

The clashing noise of the fork hitting on the ground rang through the air.



"Are you okay?" Si-yeon asked worriedly.

"Oh, I am sorry."

When Yuri tried to pick up the fork, Si-yeon called up a waiter.

"You seem dizzy. You're pale as a sheet!"

Si-yeon's voice was muffled like a drop of paint in water to Yuri's ears. She was panicking. She had not expected to hear anyone mentioning Apollo. The piece that her hands obsessively created, the only piece Yuri had ever created - the inspiration was sitting right in front of her.



Samuel  was Apollo!

She clenched her fists tightly beneath the table, feeling the blood circulation begin to get cut off. she endured with sheer grit and they eventually resumed their meal.

After a long and tense lunch, Si-yeon whispered at Yuri while Samuel  paid for the meal.

"Yuri, I am sorry for what my fiancé said. He's not a rude person, but he's been in a bad mood nowadays because of work. I apologize for him from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry."






Glaring at Si-yeon's glistening diamond ring on her ring finger, Yuri nodded. It was not Si-yeon's fault after all.

"It's ok. I'm not angry. I should leave now, thank you for inviting me." Yuri didn't drag the matter. The one thing she wanted now was to leave and away from the man!

"Of course! Thank you for your work. I hope to see you again.

Please say hi to Mr. Jean for me." Si-yeon had every intention to right the wrong and part on a friendly note.

"Sure. Thank you for hosting me."

When Samuel  finally came out of the restaurant, Yuri said her parting words to him as well.

"Thank you for inviting me. It was a pleasure to meet you." She even rewarded him with another faux smile.

Of course, it was a lie.!

However, one more lie should not be problematic to a conversation which was already covered with rampant lies.

Keeping his straight face, Samuel  nodded back at Yuri.

Yuri turned to the elevator. As soon as she entered, Yuri pressed the lobby and frantically pushed the close button over and over again. She wanted to escape from the place as soon as possible.

I need to get out of here.

Warning bells rang in the back of her mind.

The man with penetrating eyes looked at Yuri like a fierce beast right before biting the neck of its prey. She needed to escape to somewhere safe. She could not think any further.






However, fate betrayed her desperation.

A big hand slid between closing doors. The high-performing elevator's luxurious doors smoothly opened again, revealing the owner of the hand.

The man standing before Yuri, was Samuel .

It was him!


























































 

"That is weird." Si-yeon mumbled to herself, when Kim, her secretary came up beside her.

"What's so weird?" she asked, tilting her head at her boss.

"I meant Samuel . Didn't you find anything weird?" She queried, trying to make sense of what she'd seen.

"You mean, visiting you without notice?"

"That as well, and.." She trailed off, not voicing her thoughts.

I feel like I was used as an excuse. Or a bait?

A bait. to bring Yuri to the lunch table.

Si-yeon assumed Samuel  would accompany her back to the office, but he left right after lunch, saying he was under a work schedule.


Samuel's behavior today was utterly new to Si-yeon - he seemed excited and most importantly at the lounge and the gallery, his eyes were glued solely on Yuri. For some reason, this woman seemed to know him in person as well.

How do they know each other? Considering their backgrounds and social status, they shouldn't have been able to cross paths, enough to make an impression.

Si-yeon had known Samuel  ever since they were children. Of course, she expected Samuel  to have past relationships before their engagement. However, if he was dating someone currently, it was impossible for her mother to be unaware of it, as she was the one who had insisted on her engagement to Samuel .








"And?" Kim strained her ears to listen to the answer.

An awkward situation, uncomfortable feelings, and an ominous presentiment - What are these pointing at?

After a moment of hesitation, Si-yeon only shook her head. If she were to share her gloomy thoughts with her secretary, it was only a matter of time before her mother, Mrs. Go, would know about it. To be honest, Si-yeon wanted to avoid the fuss her mother would cause once she learned of this, at all costs.

"Nothing special. By the way, where's the Pepcid?" she asked, changing the subject.

"Were there any problems with lunch?"

"No, not really."

Si-yeon downed the pill with water. Dining in an uncomfortable situation usually upset her stomach all the time. And of course, her secretary, who had overseen the woman ever since she was a child, was well aware of it. She could easily sense whenever her boss had troubling thoughts.



"Do you think you can get married to him?" Kim eventually asked.

Si-yeon let out an amused chuckle. She could read her secretary's mind - Kim thought she was so uncomfortable with her own husband-to-be that she could not even dine with him without it upsetting her stomach.


"I have to. That's Mrs. Go's lifelong wish." She answered resignedly.

Si-yeon was seven years old when the woman from her father's past showed up at her house with a boy who was a year older than her. After pointing her fingers fanatically to the boy and his mother, Mrs. Go fainted on site. At that moment, she had been






pregnant with another baby. A baby that never had the chance to see this world.

It was after that moment that Mrs. Go became another person. The once naïve woman with a soft heart became stone-cold and heartless. Since then, she wished for nothing but one thing - for her daughter, Si-yeon, to rule the Daejin Group. To claim her rightful kingdom from her two older stepbrothers and two younger stepbrothers, her child needed a partner with power. A partner, so powerful and ruthless, that he would eliminate any contestant that her daughter ever had to compete with.



Samuel  ticked all the boxes that Mrs. Go had ever hoped for. And Si-yeon wanted to grant her mother's wishes by all means.

Should I figure out what happened between them? Si-yeon mused to herself.

Si-yeon did not want to be that pathetic woman who secretly did background checks on her fiancé's past, but she was his fiancée and was not open to the thought of any kind of extra-marital affair.


Stroking her bloated stomach absent-mindedly, Si-yeon tapped her temple.



"Wait at the hospital. I'm on the way. She fainted out of blue."

Driving like a madman, Samuel  stroked Yuri's cheek with his free hand. She had collapsed shortly before and lost her consciousness. He suddenly felt a chill run down his body.

He might have to change his plans.










After gathering every bit of her personal information, it was not difficult for him to find her. According to the agency, the Heart of

Apollo's installation was to be completed today, and that was where his prey would be.

He was in no rush to back her into a corner. After all, it was the process of cornering a prey that he liked the best. Taking her back as he wanted would require great patience on his part.

Surprisingly, her reaction at the lunch table was unwaveringly poised. She was clearly agitated by his presence, but she was not afraid, nor did she try to escape from him. Rather, she seemed to have been exploring something.

Was she bold, or was she simply a good actress? Only time would tell.



When he had received a text message reporting everything was prepared, he had begun his hunt. When he slid his hand between the closing doors of the elevator, the woman inside glared at him with wide, frightened eyes. Every step that Samuel  took towards her made her take a step back until there was no more room. Her pupils dilated, filled with fear.

Yes, that's how I like it. That's the fun part of hunting. He thought maliciously to himself.

Samuel  unhurriedly entered the elevator and pushed the close button. As the doors slid close, the thin air in the small elevator started to suffocate both Yuri and him. She instinctively dropped her gaze and desperately tried to compose herself.

Stuffing his hands in his pockets, Samuel  leaned against a wall before her. From head to toe, he kept his predatory eyes on her.

Yuri trembled and broke into a cold sweat.







His eyes traced the drops of sweat on her neck, he reminded himself of the first thing on the list he wanted to do for a long time- licking her lean and slender neck, much like a snake would.

To have her taste flood his tongue once more.

"Let's stop playing games."

Samuel  reached his hands and snatched her by the waist.

Fatigued, Yuri's knees buckled, and she eventually passed out.















The limp woman in his arms was notably skinny. Four years ago, Yuri was lean, but she was not as skinny as a stick that would break by a snap.

Does she even eat at all?

Jay's voice flitted through his mind.

"She has already attempted suicide a few times."

Is it related to her mental issues?

As Samuel  held Yuri in his arms, a violent and compelling appetite surged from deep within that it devoured the rest of his rationality. The appetite that he had lost for quite some time - the desire to hold her and taste every bit of her, suddenly surged in him. Unconsciously, his grip on her tightened.

When they arrived at Seoin Hospital, Jin-ho was already waiting for them by the entrance.

Jin-ho, an internist, immediately made to move the stretcher. To Samuel , he not only considered him as an employee but also a good friend.


But instead of placing her on a gurney, Samuel  carried Yuri in his arms all the way to a private ward. Surprised, Jin-ho only took a bag from the man's hand and followed without a word.

Like his brother Jin-wook, who had known Samuel  for over twenty years, Jin-ho had also known him for a long time. However, Jin-ho had never seen Samuel  treating anyone else with such possessiveness.











Jin-ho grimaced at the unconscious woman in Samuel's arms. She seemed like someone who was weak. She was tall but very skinny. And even though her eyes were closed for the moment, he could tell she was beautiful.

"Who is this?" he asked.

Gently laying Yuri on the bed in the private ward, Samuel  answered. "Mine."

"What? Then what about your fiancée?" Jin-ho asked incredulously.

Regardless of their close friendship, Jin-ho was well aware of the line drawn between them. Without an extra word, he briefly examined the woman in front of him before he prepped her up for an IV.


"Psychological shock from abrupt stress. She seems weak. If you want, I can run some further tests to examine her health in detail."

"I see."

Psychological shock? That's not good. Samuel  crossed his arms.

After shooting the man a quick, narrowed stare, Jin-ho finally left the ward.

About half an hour later, Yuri groaned, her eyes still closed. As if she were suffering from something excruciating, she tossed and turned on the bed. She shrieked from fear, before bolting awake and letting out a gasp.

"Are you okay?" Samuel  lowered himself to her level to check.

Blinking her eyes in anxiety, she rushed into his arms.









"I am sorry, I am sorry."

Samuel  flinched.

Ever since he had started tracking Yuri and discovered her real identity, Samuel  enjoyed guessing what her first words were going to be, numerous times. Would she be surprised? Afraid? Would she panic? However, an apology was not one of his many assumptions.



Clinging onto his jackets, Yuri rested her cheek on his chest. A strange feeling clambered up Samuel . Just for her, he had prepared a long list of vengeance, yet his resolve quickly crumbled at this moment.


Patiently, Samuel  had come up with well-planned revenge, and

Yuri's first words mysteriously unarmed him. Well, a ward is an inappropriate place to share the happiness of a long-waited reencounter.

Samuel  chuckled coldly and put his hands over her shoulders to pull her apart from him gently, as to not startle her. At that moment, Yuri opened her lips.

"Roy." She gasped out in a breathy voice.

As if doused in ice, Samuel's face hardened as he heard the name come out of her lips.

Damn you! How dare you call another man's name in my arms?!

Samuel  breathed in, trying to rein in his temper a thousandfold, to try not to grip her throat; instead, he only seized her shoulders in a fit of deep-seated anger.










Her shoulders hurt. When she lifted her eyelids, the first thing that came into Yuri's blurry vision was a man. Next to him was another man in a white gown. He seemed like a doctor.

She soon realized that she was at the hospital. Yuri could not see the man's face, but she could easily visualize the look on his face.

He would have a sad, concerned, and a perplexed look, as it always had been for the past three years.

"Are you okay?"

"I am sorry, I am sorry."

Over and over again, Yuri had been repeating the same thing tediously, but he deserved an answer to it. She wanted to explain to him that she did not mean to die this time. A deep sigh would come out between his lips.

In regret, Yuri called his name.

"Roy."

However, this time was different. The man's face contorted in displeasure. As if he was going to crumple her like a flimsy piece of paper, the man grabbed her shoulders with brute force.

Yuri grimaced her face in pain.

"Roy?"

"And you claim that he's just a boss and a teacher?" The man spat at her in disdain.

The man's callous voice fell over her head, freezing every part of her body. Like parting clouds, her consciousness cleared the haziness away, and soon she zeroed in on the actual man before her.








Roy was not a smoker - but this man smelled like cigarettes. Every fiber of his body exuded masculinity all over her. Yuri relaxed her grips on his arms and looked up.

Her confused eyes met the man's - incensed, his eyes were ablaze.

"Look at me, look at me in the eyes. Can you see who I am now?!"

He demanded.

Frightened, Yuri turned ashen and tried to wriggle free from his arms.



"H-How. Why." she asked shakily, as she tried to yank herself away from him in panic. His grip only tightened at her resistance, as he sneered at her.

"Don't you remember? You passed out in the elevator."

Slowly, Yuri traced her vague memory. She got into the elevator, and he followed her. Her head started hurting and cold sweat ran through her back. His entry was the last thing she could remember.



Yuri began to tidy up herself. "If you helped me when I fainted."

With furious eyes, Samuel  cut off her words.

"Why did you disappear four years ago?!"

Yuri froze at his question.

Four years ago?

His question shook Yuri. This man was indeed part of her lost memories.







But How? Why?


  











After taking a few deep breaths, Yuri opened her lips again.

" I? I don't remember you."

Samuel  smirked coldly. "Are you telling me that you don't remember a thing? If that's your only excuse, come on, that's not fun."


"I am serious! The only thing that I know about you is that you are Director Yoon's fiancé and that's it. I was just introduced to you."

She appeared incredulous, her eyes wide in shock.

"Don't give me that crap. I am not in the mood to play games." He sniggered.

"I am not trying to play anything! I do not have any memory."

BANG!

Samuel  slammed the bedhead with his fist. Because of the deafening noise, Yuri covered her ears and closed her eyes. He reached out his hand and twisted her hair with his fingers.

"I hate wasting my time. We have a lot to talk about from now on."

The voice falling down her ears sounded excited. Contrary to his heated voice, his eyes sunk to the abyss. Is it how being eaten by a beast feels like? She could only breathe and glare at him.

What created the fracture in suffocating silence in the ward was Samuel's phone inside his jacket. He checked the name on the screen, and in an annoyed voice, answered the call.

"Didn't I tell you not to call me today?"









An anxious voice hurriedly murmured that the chairman had summoned Samuel  through the phone. While the man answered the phone, Yuri pulled out the IV needle on her arm.

I hate it, I hate these needles. She was disgusted with the same repetitive situation where the fluid entered her body through the needle whenever she woke up in the hospital.

"I will come in soon. Buy some time, I am nearby."

After the phone call, Samuel  spoke to Yuri in a commanding tone.

"Come see me when I call you."

"That's not going to happen." She replied flatly.

"It is going to happen."

When Samuel  left the ward, Yuri quickly got off the bed, put on her jacket, and tidied herself. Her shoulders were still hurting, and her hands trembled. She struggled to pack her bag as she rubbed her shoulders in a bid to soothe herself. At that moment, the door opened, and the doctor entered the ward.

Yuri quickly noticed his name tag on his chest. Seoin Hospital, Internist Jin-ho, Jeong.

Jin-ho approached Yuri. "Did you get hurt?"

"No, I think I just bumped into something and it hurts a little bit."

She lied through her teeth.

"Do you have any medical conditions or medications that you take?"



"No."











Yuri intentionally shook her head. She did not want to speak a word. Since she was at Seoin Hospital, everything she said to the doctor would reach Samuel , from which medicine she took, to how her condition was. She did not want him to have any information about her.



"Ok. So I am going to check your blood pressure and run a brief blood test."

Test? Immediately, Yuri waved her hands. "No, no need for the tests. I have been tired for the past few days. I didn't sleep well as usual. I think I am okay now."

"But."

"Actually, I have some urgent things to take care of. I need to go."

Since Yuri refused flatly, Jin-ho only shrugged his shoulders.

"All right then, please take a good rest when you go home. I would still like to recommend you get tested. You have a bad complexion."


"I will see. How can I pay?" she said.

"Oh, don't worry about it. It's already taken care of. You can just leave."

It must be Samuel . Yuri concluded while opening her bag again to put her wallet back into the purse. It was not that she realized something that she did not notice before.

"Um, is this everything?"

"Yes, that's everything we have. The person who brought you passed it to us"







Her tablet was gone! It was not in her purse anymore. Only then did she realize what Samuel  meant when he said, 'it is going to happen'.


"Bastard!" Yuri clenched her teeth.

When she came back to her hotel room, Yuri searched Samuel Seo, executive director of Seoin Group. An Asian Games gold medalist at trap shooting, and the successor of Seoin Group which included eight subsidiaries. The man who had everything by birth, and also destined to have more in the future.

Staring at the picture of Samuel  on her screen, Yuri dwelled on her current situation. Her dreams, and his attitude. From what she could assemble through his reactions, she could vaguely assume what their prior relationship could have been in the past. But judging from his untoward reaction to her, their relationship could be something more serious than a fling. She frowned.

By the time I lost my memories, I was dating Hye-seong, wasn't I?

When she came back to Jinseong City after being almost hustled out of her school and art industry, Hye-seong was the first one to offer her a friendly helping hand. As Yuri was mentally exhausted, he who she had known ever since she was a child, was a great comfort.



Of course, she was aware of his father's concerns about their relationship, hence did not expect a future with Hye-seong. Yuri simply pocketed her feelings - she also had her own plans in her mind. She already knew that they were to split their ways when the time came.



Even then, she could not believe that she must have moved on so fast with another man; with a man who had a peerlessly prominent background compared to the Jins.









Afresh, Yuri wondered what happened to her on the day she lost her memories. Burying her head between her knees, Yuri scorned herself. Why did she lose so many memories? The death of her father, the death of Hye-yeon, and the man who could have possibly been her lover.



If there was one thing that she could be certain about, it was that the relationship did not end on good terms. Either he or she had left the other, and what was written on the ending page of their relationship was not happily ever after.

Yuri would not be surprised if he left her as that was more realistic than the other way around, but seemingly, the circumstances pointed to the opposite. Either way, she could not understand why Samuel  was still antagonized by her as it had been four years already and he, by all means, was engaged to another woman.

"We have a lot to talk about from now on."

Something to talk about from now on? Then why did he not talk about it in the past four years? Is it because of his engagement?

Surging questions occupied her mind. Soon, she could vaguely assume Samuel's intentions. Engagement between two of the most powerful families required precautions. If Yuri was one of his women in the past, her presence might be quite disturbing to his current fiancée. Is that the case? Whatever the answer is, another encounter with Samuel  did not seem like a good idea.

After a profound sigh, Yuri stood up.

It was already dark outside. To send the agency and Roy the final installation report by the end of the day, she needed to retrieve her tablet from him. Most of her installation notes were copied in her






laptop, but the pictures that she had taken earlier at Daejin Department Store were not updated yet and she needed them for the report. Most importantly, in order to find her memories back, she needed to meet Samuel , the man in her dreams and flashbacks.



Should I visit his office? When she keyed in Seoin Group on the search engine, her phone next to the laptop rang. It was an unfamiliar number. However, Yuri could easily guess who the caller was. After taking a few deep breaths, she pushed the answer button.



"Hello."

"You answered late."

Ignoring his response, Yuri started talking.

"I need my tablet back. It is important to me."

"You need to come and get it yourself."

Deridingly, Samuel  answered in a low tone. Yuri tried her best not to react emotionally.

"Where should I come? To your office?"

"Hotel Seoin, Suite 3001."

"Wait, hey!"

Ruthlessly, Samuel  cut off the line. Yuri did not even have a moment to be antagonized by his rude attitude. He did not need to provide anything but a hotel room number, because at that moment, Yuri found the room number somewhat familiar.

I know this room number.







A pounding started inside her head. Stumbling, she massaged her forehead.



Here I am, again.

After getting off the taxi, Yuri glared at the overwhelmingly lavish appearance of Hotel Seoin. This was her third visit. She had visited this hotel for the first time because Daejin Department Store had reserved a room in the hotel as her accommodation during her stay for installation work. The second time, she was unconsciously driven to come, after her visit to Jinseong City.

The last time she had visited the hotel, she could understand what brought her here. Now, she knew why. Because the man, Samuel Seo, was here.


Did I remember this place somehow?

Something was still engraved deep in Yuri's mind - even after removing the death of her father, the ten days, and the death of Hye-yeon from her memories completely. After she'd collected better pieces of information about Samuel , she was able to make sense of the man who had the security camera footage from Hotel

Seoin. Presumably, the man named 'Jin-wook Jeong' worked for Samuel .

Now the question was. Why did he delve into Hye-yeon Jin's death? Is her death related to Samuel.

"Miss Han?"

A familiar voice dragged Yuri out of her deep thoughts. The voice was from the cousin of the man she needed to confront. The man who possibly could have been her lover in the past. What perfect timing!







"Hello, Jae-won. Are you off now?"

"Yes! By the way, what brought you here today? Is it a coincidence? Or did you come to see me?" The man was cheerful yet cheeky.


"Oh no, I came to visit one of my acquaintances."

"I see. Well, unfortunately, I also have a plan that I cannot skip. I was worried that you came to visit me!"

Jae-won seemed disappointed, but he hid his disappointment well. As Yuri had realized it from the beginning, this man always made her feel at home. Anyone could see that he was well-educated, from a respected family with care and love.

Why are Samuel  and Jae-won so different from each other even as cousins? When Yuri reminded herself of the man who she needed to confront, her face clouded over.

Jae-won quickly changed the topic. "Is the installation finished?"

"Yes, it was done today."

"Then, are you leaving Korea soon?"

After taking a few seconds, Yuri answered. "I think I am going to stay for a bit. I need to take care of some stuff."

"Well, that is great news to me!" Jae-won smiled. "You can take your time. I can wait for your call."

Nothing forceful, but an insisting voice of Jae-won landed on Yuri's ears.



After entering the elevator, she closed her eyes. Whenever she breathed, something suppressed her chest and left her feeling






nauseated. Even when she walked through the lavish aisles, she felt queasy.

In front of Suite 3001, she dropped her head and looked down at her shoes. Somehow, she felt like she had done this before. Here, in this place, at some point in time that she does not remember.

With shaking fingers, she rang the bell. Without the slightest noise, the heavy door opened.







Even before she had taken her finger off the doorbell, the door had already soundlessly opened. A surge of emotions flooded her senses as fragments of memories assaulted her mind.

It was then that a curt voice brought her thoughts to an abrupt halt.



"You're late."

Standing at the door, an unbuttoned shirt clinging on his skin, an alarming glint in his dark orbs was the man from her canvas. her nightmares-Samuel .

Yuri soon reined in her composure and retorted in an impassive manner.

"You didn't tell me I had a fixed time to keep."

Samuel  moved sideways with a raised brow. He noticed she still had her sharp tongue.

"Come in," he said unceremoniously.

However, the girl stood rooted to her spot, she had no intention of stepping in and she made sure to make her purpose of visit clear.

"I only came to get back the tablet."

Samuel  shot her a lazy glance, his eyes still and unfathomable.

"You're free to stand there all night if you want."

He went back inside without another word. He knew her all too well, her defiance and courage. He also knew how to get her to do his bidding.









Yuri had no choice but to follow him. The door closed behind her with an ominous sound. Samuel  was sitting on the living room sofa with a lit cigarette. She felt his gaze on her through the smoke as she slowly sat on the opposite side. She tried to speak without betraying any emotion.



"Please give it back to me."

Samuel's smile did not reach his eyes, and Yuri was afraid all the more for it.

"You still don't know me?" He sniggered.

"I don't remember." She replied impassively.

"Then, I'll have to make you."

Samuel  rose, his hand found her face. She felt like lightning had struck her in his touch. There was a hand that caressed her face in the past. She gasped out loud and sank back to the sofa.

"Wa-wait!"

Surprised by the sound she made, Yuri clasped a hand over her mouth. Her heart was pounding as it would burst. Tremors ran down her body in fear.

Samuel  only laughed at her response.

"Do you remember now?"

"I, I don't know what happened, but I lost parts of my memory.

Especially the last four to five years of my life. So I can't remember you."



"I remember telling you not to fool around with me."









The ends of his lips twisted. Samuel  removed the cigarette from his mouth and slowly stubbed it out on the ashtray.

"You know me."

"How can you be sure?" Yuri probed him, her eyes searching his face.



"You respond to me. Then, now, you're still trembling."

Yuri tried to hide her hands, but it was too late. He knew exactly how she would react. Her already pale face turned ashen.

"That's because-"

"Why, is it a selective memory loss?"

"I'll explain." She then cleared her throat before continuing. "I received a hypnosis treatment for my memory, and afterward I saw you in my dreams. I don't know anything about you except your face. If Ms. Yoon had not introduced us, I would have never known your name."



"What caused your memory loss?"

Yuri hesitated before replying. "I don't know. I don't even remember what happened then."

Unfortunately, her explanation didn't sound plausible to the man before her.

"It must be convenient for you to say that you don't remember everything I ask. Don't you have a better excuse or an explanation?"


His sneer deepened instead, Yuri felt faint. She did not want to face him, who seemed to be not interested in having a conversation






and only interrogated her. She was tormented by her memory loss. She had lost her father, her friend, and herself. The trauma had burdened her so much that she could not create her pieces anymore. If there was an excuse or an explanation, she was the one who wanted to hear it the most.



"What do you want to hear from me? I told you I don't remember!"

She was agitated, she wished to be left alone.

"You might want to remember when there's a chance. That is if you don't want other people to get involved."

"What do you mean?" It was a sheer sign of threat hurled at her.

"The man who is your boss and your teacher is well-esteemed in his profession. His skills and reputation hold up, and people tell me his uncle is a successful entrepreneur in that field too. I can easily make trouble for them if there's something in it for me."

Yuri's pale face now reddened in anger. The situation she found herself in did not make any sense. A man who took what was hers made her come to him and was now threatening her.

She glared at Samuel . "I can make trouble for you too. Do you want me to call Ms. Yoon? I can say that your fiancé is throwing baseless threats at me after calling me to his hotel room."

Yet, surprisingly, her words didn't have as much effect on him. Samuel  only smiled.

"Do it." He provoked her.

"What?!" Yuri was stunned.

"Do it. I don't care." She was taken aback by his response.










No matter how she looked at him to catch a glimpse of his thoughts, his face did not betray anything. Actually, he was looking at her with amusement.







"I'll call her. You can take the phone and tell her what you just said. I'm also curious about how she will respond."

True to his words, Samuel  took his cell phone out from the jacket he had taken off next to him. He pressed the speed dial to call Si-yeon, and turned to speaker mode and placed it on the table.

"Yes, Samuel ."

Yuri flinched, hearing Si-yeon's voice. What was Samuel  thinking? He resumed speaking with his eyes fixed on Yuri.

"The person I'm in a meeting now wants to speak to Director Yoon.

Do you have a minute?"

"It's all right. Is it a business matter?"

"You'll know after hearing it."

Samuel  pointed at the phone on the table with a smile on his lips.

"Hello, this is Director Yoon from Daejin Department Store. Who is this?"



Yuri hesitated as she remembered the wife of a professor she had met before. When Yuri asked for help, the wife had told her that it was her fault of having given him leeway. She could not open her mouth as the image of the woman shielding her husband latched in her.



Si-yeon was repeating herself.

"Hello? This is Si-yeon Yoon. Samuel , is there something wrong?

No one's answering."









Samuel  answered with a concealed sneer.

"It seems that there was too much alcohol involved. This, after asking me to call you that badly."

"It can't be helped. Please introduce me later."

"I'll do that."

Samuel  slowly pressed the end button.

"You have to wisely choose people to bluff."

Yuri had lost the game. He knew that she would not be able to act on the threat.

Hence, she stood up and rapidly walked to the entrance. However, Samuel's tight grip caught her first before she made it to the door.

"I never gave you escape as a choice." He sniggered.

"Let go of me!"

In no time, Yuri was pushed to the wall with some force. Samuel's shadow engulfed her silhouette. She raised her head and met his eyes filled with desire. enough to swallow her whole.

"Why are you doing this? No matter what we were, aren't we over?"

She was incensed.

"Who says it's over?"

Samuel  lifted her chin with one hand. Yuri instinctively tried to pull back, but she was already against the wall. He held her waist tightly with the other arm.

"You say you don't remember."








"I don't, but I know that much. Because we broke up, you didn't look for me in America. and even got en-engaged."

It was difficult for Yuri to open her lips. She trembled wherever his breath brushed against her. Her head was spinning from his scent mixed with cigarette smoke.

"I knew you to be 'Hye-yeon Jin'." He brushed her hair away and whispered with his lips against her ear.

What did he mean by that? She had no time to think as he roughly held her head back and kissed her.

"Uh!"

Samuel  strengthened his grip on her chin to pry her lips open. His tongue ravaged hers in a breathtaking kiss. His sensual scent tinted with cigarette smoke overwhelmed her. She tried to push him away, but it only made him move in closer and deeper until she felt numb. No matter how she tried to get away from him, the kiss became rougher, and the wet sounds they made were becoming messier.



His tongue was forcibly taking her breath away. He slipped her trench coat off of her with a hand while she was trying to get her breath back. He then violently tugged at her blouse. The buttons popped out to reveal a simple beige bra.

Yuri screamed and tried to hide what was displayed in front of him.

Samuel  spoke in a level voice even after that passionate kiss. "It's not my type. Is it his?"

He recklessly pushed up her bra and squeezed her breats. Yuri shuddered everywhere when his hands pressed her hardening nipples.








"Stop!"

Samuel  easily grabbed both of her wrists with one hand and held them up her head. She felt his tongue wrapping around her nipples and sucking. He then rolled one in his mouth while fondling the other with his other hand.


He left red marks on her white skin as he hungrily sucked and grabbed. She let out a shaking breath. She trembled everywhere Samuel's hands, lips, and tongue roamed. Her skin began to show a faint blush.


Samuel  was enjoying her sweet skin to his heart's content when he noticed the marks left by his hand on her shoulder.

"It must have hurt. You always bruised so easily."

He kissed the bruise on her shoulder. She was writhing as she felt him hardening against her lower abdomen.

"Let go! I don't want this!" She tried to push him away.

"Did you already forget? I said you couldn't refuse when I want you. Stop moving. I never did it like this, and I don't want to hurt you."

He spoke in a threatening tone as he lifted her up. His body, remaining immobile no matter what Yuri did. It did not matter whether she shouted, cried, or resisted, he would have her.


Samuel  roughly laid Yuri down on the bed and took off her skirt. As the long cloth snaked down her thighs, her slim legs

and underwear came into view. Her blouse was already wide open and could no longer hide her breasts. The red marks left on her white skin drove him crazy.

He hurriedly stripped his clothes off, displaying his sculpted physique and erection as he came to her bare as the day he was born.


As the bare-bodied man neared, Yuri drew back; not out of fear but astonishment. She had sketched the body of the man in her memories. Yuri had even made molds of the beautiful body she could see whenever she closed her eyes. She just had never imagined that it would now come to her in flesh. What's more, belonging to Samuel Seo-the man who wreaked havoc into her life just recently.



Samuel  grabbed her ankle and roughly pulled her to him. He removed the clothing that remained on her and spread her legs out.


"Ah!"

Yuri shuddered like a fish forced out of the water as his thumb touched the most sensitive spots deep inside her. The man chuckled and relentlessly pushed his fingers into her.

Yuri was still dry and hence, in pain. She grabbed his wrist and pushed his chest away.

"It hurts!" She glared at him.

"You'd become wet with only a kiss before."








Disregarding her words, he simply plunged his fingers deeper. Her face creased in pain as she felt his digits moving inside her.

"It hurts! Please, stop." She pleaded.

"It's so tight. Your old teacher hasn't had you much." He sniggered.

"I said that's not true!" She glared daggers at him. "I'm not in that kind of relationship with Roy."

His fingers came in deeper after stroking her clitoris. He licked her earlobe as if to soothe her, circled his fingers in as she became less tight than before.

Yuri shut her eyes tightly as his fingers seemed to be everywhere inside her. He pressed a particular spot while observing her response.


"Do you still like it here?" he asked in a raspy voice.

"Ah!" She felt electrified.

Samuel  had once known her body better than Yuri did. Even after four years, he found the places that aroused her quickly.

She grabbed his shoulders as tremors overtook her. She felt herself getting damp under his relentless ministrations.

He stirred her until wet sounds filled the room. She turned her head away in embarrassment, but the man forced her to watch him with a hand on her chin. He slowly licked his fingers as he met her eyes.


"I remember your taste."

Yuri blushed as she watched him lick her juices.









"Don't do this!" she said softly.

"Yes, I did not plan to do this, but now you rush me." Saying so, he held one of her legs over his shoulder. "It's been too long."

He rubbed his penis just before he entered and lightly bit her lower lip. Yuri gripped his shoulders tighter as she felt a massive heat against her body. She felt as if she was split in two when Samuel  thrust inside her.


"Ah!"

She was hit with excruciating pain. Even though she had become wet under his caresses, it had been too long since she had accepted a man inside. He was too big and hot as he forced his way inside her walls.


She tilted her head back, her lips trembled. Above her, Samuel  groaned as he reached her deepest regions.

"It should be like this." He whispered hoarsely.

Lodged deep inside her, he stared into her eyes without moving. Teardrops hung on her long and lush eyelashes. He held her in his arms while she struggled to get her breath back. He traced along her forehead, brows, the bridge of her nose, closed eyelids, lips with his eyes, and his gaze traveled down her delicate neckline, collarbone, arm, hands, fingers, and nails.

His gaze stopped at Yuri's hands that were fisting the bedsheets. They had the same short nails as a child's but were homely compared to the rest of her body. They were continuously drawing and making something, so her hands were wreathed with calluses. Everything about her was beautiful, but Samuel  remembered her hands best.










"I finally found you, Yuri Han."

Taking her hand, he planted a kiss on her warm palm. He then grabbed her thighs and pushed her body closer. She felt like she was being impaled, ravaged by a monster even. She clenched her teeth as he forcibly opened her to him

Large hands soon found her pair of mounds kneading them to his contentment while he softly bit the soft skin of her neck. Yuri felt arousal taking over pain as he rubbed her reddened nipples and moved his hips in a fast rhythm.

It was a sensation long left in the past. As he moved in and out with long and deep thrusts, the top of his head hit the headboard.

His movements were violent and rough, but her body remembered him. The bond with Samuel Seo was something deeper than a simple physical encounter.

Strange sensation filled her as the passionate sex she had in her dream became a reality. Was this what I had left behind in my memories? Her world felt more real than it ever had in the last four years. Her consciousness spiraled down in a whirlwind of sensations.



Samuel  also seemed to feel her mind drifting away and kissed her as if he wanted to swallow her.

"Look at who you are with now." He whispered to her ears. This was followed by a short cry emanating from her lips.

"Ah!"

She felt a sharp taste in her mouth as he pried it open. Their tongues in a familiar dance, she felt alive. His hips ground against her, while his lips pressed down on hers. This was not the







imaginary world where Yuri had wandered in torment. It was not a dream, but a reality where only Samuel  existed.

Her strength left her as the man expertly moved and twisted his hips. A vein stood out in his forehead as he felt Yuri go hot and wet underneath him. Everything was beyond sensations now.








Chapter fifty - Feasting.

It seemed Samuel  had forgotten his long standing tenet- sex was a game of pleasure between a man and a woman. But right now, the only thing left was an instinct screaming within that he had to have her.


The sound of flesh against flesh rang loudly. As pain turned to pleasure inch by inch, Yuri felt moans escaping from her mouth.

"Ah, ah!"

She was heady as she felt him inside, and the sensations were waking something that was lying dormant in her. A light blinked beyond the black curtains of her memory.

What is this?

Something was trying to rip and come out of the curtains. Yuri reached out and tried to grab it without thought. However, her hands touched Samuel's face instead of her fragmented memory.

A suppressed moan slipped out of Samuel's mouth. Yuri was startled to find a strange sensation of something burning rolling within her. The man held her tightly as she tried to escape.

"Stay still." He growled a warning and hugged her hips even closer.

He was in a frenzy, seemingly trying to leave as much of himself in her as he also climaxed.

Samuel  did not take himself out even after he was done. Yuri tried to push him away, but he remained hard inside her. He rolled her over to the side and pulled her into his arms, burying himself in her neck and reaching out to grab her twin peaks.

Yuri flinched and shrank as he toyed with her hard nipples.







"You haven't enjoyed yourself yet." His raspy voice sounded by her ear.



His hands wandered below her flat stomach and between her legs. She was wet with his come and her juices, and was still wide open with his penis inside. He caressed where they met and thrust deeper.


"We are going for it now." He declared.

"Stop!" She made a feeble attempt.

He was deep inside her. Her walls engulfed and tightened their hold on him as if she had been waiting for this very moment. She was shocked, her body betrayed her and welcomed Samuel  in. Her body was now thoroughly awake from this brief experience. He filled her, and she felt her body fit him in. Her skin was so sensitive that she could feel his shape and pulsating veins.

"Ah-"

Her moans were different from before. Her breasts were crushed in his grip. As he rolled her nipples with his palms, her

husky moans became louder.

"Ah, umm-"

The sound was pure music to his ears. Samuel's hand lowered to stroke her intimate spots. He was still ravaging her, where they remained connected. The lewd noises and the springs of the mattress rang in her ears.

He worked her sweet spots.

"You're incredible. Still so tight." He whispered between pants.










She felt herself being pulled along with him with each movement. She was already soaked, and her body pulled as if to suck him in. He knew that he should not overwhelm her with his strength, but he could not control himself. Every time he plunged into her, her body rattled as if she was about to break.

"Ah-"

Yuri gasped in shock and passion with every movement Samuel  made. He stared at her face overwhelmed with pleasure.

"Why did you disappear?" He demanded out of nowhere.

He spoke in a voice that froze Yuri's flushed body.

Between wakefulness and slumber treads a fine line of clarity. When one is exhausted physically, exhilarated mentally, this line of clarity is at its hazy best.

Yuri was in and out of stupor. One moment she was in pain, and another ecstasy. She had lost all semblance of time and place. Her senses had long forsaken her.

That's why, his question, out of nowhere, seemed surreal at first.

When she came to it, with a lot of effort, Yuri managed to open her mouth only after sensing that the movements had stilled.

"What?" She couldn't even hear herself.

"We had been doing this until the morning of my business trip. And you simply vanished when I was away? for four years!" Anger, accusation, reproach, and even a hint of feeling betrayed, was evident in the tone.


In his frenzy, Samuel  plunged into Yuri with a heady sound. The more he ravaged her, the more insatiable he was. Tonight, he







cared about nothing but feeding his feral carnal appetite like there would be no tomorrow.

Her breath choked as he flicked her already swollen clitoris. Her world turned black as a fierce pleasure pierced through everywhere.


"Ah-"

Yuri's thighs trembled, her back arched. She tightened her hold on him as juices flowed out. Out of her control, her body seemed to have woken up from a long period of venereal void.

Samuel  also creased his face and held his breath. He had come and was trying to enjoy her as much as possible? he found it impossible to control himself nor did he desire to. He had plunged into a bottomless abyss after all.

"Let go a little. The night's still long."

Even before his raspy words reached her, he had begun to stroke her clitoris. However, Yuri was limp from the sensations that repeatedly overwhelmed her. Samuel  clicked his tongue as he observed her heave with her face buried in the sheets.

He was not dense to not know how a woman felt when he was inside her. He was well-aware he had overwhelmed her, her body was too weak to go further.

Yuri was of a slender build, smooth muscles in her arms and legs; a decent vitality, and nimble. But now, she looked almost emancipated, demure, and too frail for him? like a light breeze would crumble her.


Samuel's erect!on was still high as he extracted himself from her core.









Those long-forgotten carnal desires had rushed back in hysteria.

Like a parched earth devouring water? a famished beast prey, Samuel  who had never recovered from Yuri's sudden disappearance from his life, upon their unexpected reunion, had succumbed to delirium and abandoned all reason. There was only one thing governing him: he would not let go of her again.

Yes, she was spent. No, he was not sated.

He gulped some wine and fed it to Yuri with his mouth. Eyes still closed, she frowned, at the taste of the drink.

"I don't want alcohol," she said meekly.

"You have to drink."

Samuel  licked the wine that trickled from her mouth to her neck.

Yuri's color finally returned after he gave a few more swallows. As he spread her thighs, their juices flowed out of where he had released.


Like a wolf roused by the scent of blood, his blood boiled at the sight of the oozing fluid? he wanted her even more badly. As he slid himself in, because of the wine, her hold on him was tighter than before. He pushed away her hands that were trying to hide her face. Her inebriated, flushed face was breathtakingly beautiful.

"I never knew I could see you and be inside you like this again." He sounded like he had found his long lost treasure.

He kissed her, his tongue ravaged everywhere inside her mouth. He was feasting on her, up and below.

  



Samuel  indulged himself to his heart's content? if there was such a thing as content that is. Following his instincts, he plunged deep into her core and stroked the inside walls. His taut abdomen crushed and rubbed her clitoris.

Yuri shed incessant tears as waves of pain and pleasure deluged her. However, the man still dominated her without any mercy. He thrust relentlessly, using his tongue and fingers to make her respond to him whenever she would span.

He came when her vision blurred like when she was in the nightmare. Samuel  poured himself into her as he kissed her neck and collarbone with a low groan. Wholly spent her hand on his shoulder dropped with a thump.

"Hey!"

Samuel  lightly tapped her cheek but got no response. Finally, his senses seemed to return, he was able to think.

He had not had sex like this even during his twenties. Such verve and the uncontrollable, obsessive passion that made him forget himself and focus only on the coital pleasures, was foreign to him. But he knew, this woman was the only one who had such an effect on him.



Samuel  pulled away from Yuri and ran his hand through her rumpled hair. Her swollen red lips stood out on her pale face. A mix of liquids from what they had just done spilled in his tracks. There was a still unsatisfied desire within the sexual afterglow he was feeling at the moment.



"You drive me crazy." He whispered in her ear.



Holding her head, he gently put a pillow underneath. After covering her naked body with a quilt, Samuel  put on a bathrobe and grabbed a cigarette. He went to the terrace and lit it, trying to suppress his hankerings with long swallows.

He was on the verge of mounting and feasting on her like a beast? it didn't matter whether she could take it or not? it was like the pent up emotions from these past four years, had found a release.

After determinedly reining in the brute of desire, he took another puff before called Jay.

"Have you checked Yuri Han's treatment records?" Was the opening sentence.

"The doctor in the clinic is careful with managing the documents, so it will take some time to get the records in full. Her illness is so tricky that there's a mountain of consultation records."

"What's the name of the illness?"

"Transient global amnesia. It's a memory disorder from psychological trauma rather than the workings of the brain. This woman seems to have lost her entire memory of a specific period."

Memory loss of a particular period?

Samuel's brows furrowed. Was it true she did not remember him?

Her temperature, pulse, and breathing he felt in his hands were too real for Yuri to be feigning. No matter how good an actress she was, it would be impossible to control those things.

As he listened and thought, he did not know how much he should believe.









He ended the call and went back to the living room. Picking up

Yuri's bag lying at the entrance, he sat on the sofa and rummaged through the contents. Writing supplies, notebook, catalog, a cosmetics pouch, her passport, and a wallet? most of her belongings were simple black without any embellishments.

The ends of Samuel's lips lifted. Still the same taste.

One thing they had in common was their preference for clothes and ornaments with clean cuts. And by the sight of it, it seemed to have remained despite the memory loss. Somehow, this trivial discovery brought a tinge of warmth within him.

Lighting another cigarette, he took out her wallet and passport. He compared the picture in the passport with her name. The pictures used in her license and passport were a younger version of Yuri, but they were undoubtedly her.

Setting these aside, he reached out to the booklet. It was a catalog showcasing the profiles of artists in an exclusive contract with the agency Yuri belonged to.

When his eyes landed on the picture on the opening page, they were suffused with malice.

"So, this is her teacher and boss."

From the picture, it was obvious Roy Jean was a handsome man. He was forty-four but looked younger as some artists did. Ash hair, sharp eyes, and a lean and muscular body showed through the image.


Samuel  went livid whenever he remembered Yuri going straight to Roy, calling and hugging him the moment she woke up. According to a report from America, this Roy was the most intimate relationship Yuri had there.








He was roughly turning over the pages until he found Yuri's profile at the end. Since she had just made her debut, there was nothing noticeable except for her photo and pictures of her work. Samuel's gaze fixed on the list of her works for a moment. There was a name that stuck out.



Apollo.

Was this the work that was the motif for the 'Heart of Apollo'?

There was no way to know as this particular work, unlike the rest, was without an image. Since a price tag was not listed, this work was not for sale.

Samuel  kept digging through the bag until he found something out of the ordinary. It was a pill bottle. Actually, it was a transparent plastic box that was the size of a small book containing neatly packaged pills in ziplock pouches. There were at least six different kinds in large amounts. They could've been vitamins, but the colors of the pills were too bright to be so.



Samuel  did not specialize in medicine but knew what medicine Seoin Pharmaceutics, a subsidiary, developed. Taking his knowledge into account, these vibrant pills were typically psychotropic drugs. He wondered at the sheer amount of pills Yuri carried with her.



Opening the pillbox, he examined each pill with a stiff face. Opiates, stabilizers, antidepressants, and painkillers. He knew most of them but could not recognize the white pills.

Since the product name was not listed, he deduced they must be a prototype.

If she needs to take this much medicine at the same time, what happened to Yuri?






She is said to have mental problems. They say she tried to take her own life multiple times, and it's become a habit.

I don't know what happened, but I lost parts of my memory. Especially the last four to five years of my life. So I don't remember you.

Jay's report and Yuri's condition? Furthermore, the fact she left him? disappeared, lost her memory, and now was taking all these drugs. Samuel's thoughts sank deep in his eyes.
