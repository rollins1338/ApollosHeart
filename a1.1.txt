.


Jae-won returned to his office with a stiffened expression and turned on the computer. He booted the program and typed in the security code. Then, he recklessly opened up a file. He found what he was looking for. He let out a small cry at the name that popped up on the screen.



"Oh my goodness!"

He roughly rubbed his face with his dry hands. Suddenly everything started to make sense: every inconceivable thing Samuel had done finally made sense.

The file that Jae-won was looking at was a list of guests who had canceled their hotel reservation. It had to be here. The name that Samuel called for when he was drunk. that name had to be here.


[Yuri Han.]

The name that he called out so sorrowfully and intimately. wreathed in such pain.









Late at night, Jin-wook poured soju for a man at an old bar nearby.

"How's work? Is it doable"

The man receiving the drink was an ex-manager of Hotel Jinseong, and current valet parking employee of Hotel Seoin. He was the man who recognized Yuri Han from the picture.

"It's getting difficult to work since I'm becoming old. But what other choice do I have? My first-born just started college a year behind. The youngest just started freshman year in high school."

He replied with a depressed voice.

"Oh, I'm sorry to hear, but I also understand how you're feeling. My youngest is also in high school," Jin-wook said calmly.

And thus, the two men nonchalantly chatted about life and other important things as they drank. Jin-wook decided to get to the point when the bottle was almost empty.

"Driver Su-won Han. What was he like as a person?"

"You mean Mr. Han? To be exact, Mr. Han was called a 'driver,' but actually, he wasn't someone who should be working under others. He graduated from a prestigious college, you see, and he even owned a business in Seoul." There was a degree of respect in his voice, and he truly meant every word of praise.

Jin-wook was a little surprised. Throughout his research so far, this was something he hadn't come across. He had assumed the man would be an ordinary blue collar at the most, surely not a learned one.


"Then why did he work as a driver for President Jin?" he asked.









A graduate from an ordinary college could easily find a white collar job to say nothing of people like Su-won Han who had passed out of prestigious college. So, this man had chosen to toil for a scum like Myung-je Jin when he could be sitting in a posh office in a business suit.



"The two were neighbourhood friends since childhood. I heard Han borrowed quite some money from Jin when he was expanding his business and his wife got ill. Later, he even took out loans under
Jin's name. Jin was a President, but he wasn't a brainy one. All he knew was how to order gangsters to break a few things here and there. So when the business expanded, he wanted a person he could trust and rely on, but someone he could look down upon at the same time."



"And that was Mr. Han." Jin-wook concluded in the end.

"You can put it that way."

The man ordered another bottle of alcohol and opened the lid. Jin-wook who was busy jotting down in a small notebook popped a question.


"How well do you know of Mr. Han's accident?"

"Just as much as the newspaper articles. It did seem quite odd, though. Mr. Han never drank typically because he didn't know when President Jin would call for him. But a man like him ran towards a car intoxicated-"

"Did you see Mr. Han on the day of the accident by any chance?"

Jin-wook probed.

"The day of the accident? To be frank, Mr. Han had gone missing a few days before the incident. There was someone else driving President Jin around."






This was news, nowhere had he come across this. And needless to say, the seeds of doubts were sprouting. Jin-wook dug in.

"What has happened?"

"Well, he had quite a big argument with President Jin."

"Because of what?"

The man was more than willingly chirping the whole story non-stop when suddenly, he shut his mouth like a clam. A puzzled Jin-wook stared at the man.

The man awkwardly tried to change the topic. "Working outdoors is so cumbersome now that I'm an old man. I would like to switch to a position that works inside of the hotel before the weather gets any colder."


The man's intentions were obvious. He was expecting a reward for helping. Well, there are no free lunches, and who better than the cadaver dog Jin-wook to know it best? He simply nodded in assent.


"That would depend on what you are able to give me. Do you have anything special you would like to share with me?"

The man's eyes glistened as he happily noticed an opportunity. He said slyly, "I have the security camera footage of President Jin and

Mr. Han arguing in the hotel lobby. To be honest, Jin had told me to delete it, but I kept a backup just in case. Now that Jinseong Construction is out of business and Jin dead, I thought it had become irrelevant, but like they say nobody knows what the future holds." He smiled in satisfaction apparently basking in self-praise on being insightful.












"I'll make sure to report it to the executives. I don't have the right to make decisions about the reward by myself." Jin-wook stated matter-of-factly.


"Hope to hear from you."

As an afterthought, Jin-wook asked, "By any chance, is there anyone else who knows about the argument between President Jin and Mr. Han?"

"Hyeon-ah Kim." The man muttered a name and looked up. "Right, she should know about it. That day, I was late to work because my shift started in the afternoon. I got a hang of what was going on only after I watched the security camera footage. The person in charge of the lobby was Hyeon-ah Kim that day."

Hyeon-ah Kim. Jin-wook cringed as the face of a woman with a kind smile and hidden intentions appeared in his mind. She was a woman he could not predict even after years of working with all sorts of people.


The man emptied the last glass and got up from his seat.

Something felt very strange. He didn't expect things to become so serious when he initially started his search for Yuri Han. Looking at how things were panning, even a veteran investigator like him couldn't help wonder- What was at the end of all this?







The next morning Jin-wook was summoned to Samuel's office. Just as he was stepping out of the elevator, he bumped into

Manager Choi right in front of the director's office.

Jin-wook was familiar with Manager Choi, as she had worked for Samuel for quite a few years. He also knew that she was to accompany Yuri Han to America.

Isn't she supposed to be on the plane right now? Then why is she standing here?

Unable to hold in his curiosity, Jin-wook asked her. "Weren't you supposed to go to America today? Why are you still here?"

"Yeah, but it got suddenly canceled." Manager Choi replied.

"Cancelled?! Why?" He was taken aback.

"I'm not sure. I think they had an argument. he told me not to let her out of the house for a while."

An argument, for what reason? Jin-wook made a mental note to ask Samuel about it as he entered the assistant's office. when he spotted him, Manager Lee sent him a desperate signal for help.

Something's up. Jin-wook gently knocked and entered the director's office. Samuel was going over his paperwork.

"You must have had a bit too much drink."

Samuel was hiding his face with a pair of very thick glasses, but Jin-wook was able to notice easily. In college, the two used to go to bars to drink, although he never won against Samuel in drinking games.










"I guess I lost control."

The last time he lost control so dramatically was four years ago, after confirming Hye-yeon Jin's death. But didn't he have the woman by his side right now? If he allowed her to go to America in the first place, they must've been close enough to be friends.

Samuel handed the papers to Jin-wook without adding any words.

"It's about K Pharmaceuticals. Find the bastard that vanished and deal with him firsthand. And make sure to follow me on the trip to Busan the day after tomorrow."

Normally Manager Lee joined the business trips, but from how he asked Jin-wook to go instead, this trip must be confidential.

"Is it complicated to explain?"Jin-wook asked.

"A little. Some iffy stuff in between things." Samuel impassively replied.

"How many employees would you like to bring?"

"No need for many. Two would be enough."

"Yes sir. Oh, and about the investigation on Yuri Han's father-"

"Put that on hold for now." Samuel sharply interrupted Jin-wook. He frowned and took off his glasses. Then he massaged his temples as if he had a headache.

"I beg your pardon?" Jin-wook was confused. He was the one who wanted him to dig, and yet now he seemed uninterested.

"Don't want to see for a while." He clarified.

However, the sensitive Jin-wook noticed the voice full of aching. He doesn't want to see what for a while. The research? Possibly Yuri






Han? But he knew better than to prod, the reticent man had already said too much. In the end, he just kept his silence and exited the office.

All alone in his office now, Samuel rose and walked to the window, took out a cigarette, and leaned on the sill. He didn't want to see. He didn't want to see whom? He didn't want to see. the reflection of himself in the window.

There was no denying that what he had done last night was rape. Since when did he treat women that way? The man was a ruthless, savage master, but never had he forced himself onto anyone.
Neither was he wanton nor willful when it came to women. He had always treated them in a dignified manner, else why would he be so sought after by the fairer sex despite changing partners often?

Anger and disdain culminated into self-hatred and together they devoured every iota of his being. His act was no different from that of a savage beast. abominable & heinous. No amount of self-loathing could purge his barbarism.

Truth was, he wasn't mad at the drug itself. He was mad at how she treated her body so carelessly. Like it were an object that wasn't concerned with herself. it was like she had a death wish, indulging in those medicines. But the bigger truth was, he was furious that she was ruining the body that would one day

bear his children.

Yes, that was the actual triggering factor.

It's just the way you know. I did drugs. So what? And what does that have to do with you?

There's no difference between me and that dog you stuffed by yourself! I'm not your possession!







Does it annoy you that your Barbie doll is a drug addict? Does it disgust you that you made out with such filth?




Yuri's dramatic reaction was shocking enough to derange Samuel. He was so exasperated that his eyes alternated between red and black. He wanted to seem like a good man, but his effort to withhold his true emotions exposed his violent streak to the maximum. In the end, the demon within had reigned over and how.



Scenes from the night inundated his senses - how Yuri turned her head away, shut her eyes allowing him to shake her body like a lifeless being. He didn't know when she had abandoned hope, but those stifled painful moans still pierced his heart.

Why had he not noticed them then? Why had he gotten carried away by the savagery?!

Pain was a byword to the pleasures that would follow. Every time they had been intimate, no matter how much time he spent in caressing and stimulating her, she would still be wreathed with pain. he didn't dare imagine how much she had suffered when he had penetrated so forcefully without care or precaution? When he had hounded and pounded her underneath. Even while trembling to her fingertips, she had not made a squeak. Except for the few errant moans when he had moved intensely, the girl seemed to have shut her lips and the world around.



Her response or lack thereof only served to infuriate him further. Had she cried out loud, screamed in pain, or even apologized, his fury wouldn't have been fueled to beyond limit, he would've even been lenient towards her. The manner in which she had withstood it all was as if it were some kind of a challenge she had no choice but to go through. Needless to say, it was the very thing that had






driven him crazy. It was as if the time they spent together was time for Yuri to patiently endure.

I'm just the worst.

The man reflected in the window bitterly admitted his sin. He inhaled deeply into his cigarette and sighed out a puff of smoke. The smoke veiled the man.








"I'm sorry. You can't leave the house for a while."

The guards had blocked Yuri's way to the airport. With bag and baggage, she stood at the door in a daze. The first-class ticket to New York City in hand became but a useless piece of trash. And as such, her sentence had begun.

Only the man knew how many days she would be spending locked within the walls of this house. In the end, she had no choice but to come up with a last-minute excuse to her uncle for her abrupt cancellation of plans.


Manager Choi could not stay still out of guilt although the situation was not her fault. But no matter how sorry she felt, there was nothing she could do. Pity the girl as she may, but the truth was she lacked all the courage to go against her master.

A lot had changed since that night. Some changes were shocking, while some expected. Sebastian had moved elsewhere. Yes, the taxidermied dog that had adorned the mantle in the living room had relinquished his abode of years giving the place a somewhat deserted feel.



The master of the house had not returned once, not even his shadow had been spotted on the premises. The clothes, shoes, and bags that were occasionally delivered had stopped too. Those were no ordinary gifts. Even Yuri, who had no interest in fashion brands, could tell they were all from the most luxurious designer brands. As such the house only had her and the servants along with Manager Choi and bodyguards.



It had been a while since she had had quiet nights especially after getting together with Samuel. Most nights she would be so spent that before she even knew it she would have slipped into a deep






slumber. She didn't prefer to sleep that way but what choice did she have in the matter. She was someone who liked her nights peaceful, perhaps 'cause she was apprehensive about the man?

Why then was she having a hard time sleeping now since she was left to her peace?

That's right, 'ever since' sleep had evaded her. She would just lay in her bed, surrounded in darkness, staring at the ceiling. letting her mind wander to where not. but sleep, she did not.

And today was no exception. After hours of turning off the lights and lying in bed, she was still fidgeting wide awake. She pressed her head onto the pillow and counted the days. One, two, three. it had already been a week now.

The first two days were absolutely intimidating. So much so that she jumped at her own shadow. She was afraid that Samuel would come back to embrace her body. violently once again. She was scared she would be pinned down again and rammed into mercilessly. She was battered and bruised, mentally and physically. and the wounds just refused to heal.



When the third day arrived, she still couldn't shake the man off her chest. His deep dark eyes, frigid voice, nonchalant visage kept haunting her, no matter how tight she closed her eyes, shut her ears. Thus, the girl was confined in a dismal dungeon that she just couldn't escape from.



The changes in her behaviour didn't go unnoticed by Manager Choi. Although she didn't know the exact situation of their relationship, she saw that Yuri was preoccupied with thoughts of Samuel day in and day out. She was an experienced lady, so although she didn't know what had transpired between the two, she still felt sympathetic towards the girl who was on house arrest







now. So, this day, she had subtly apprised her on the director's impending business trip to Busan.

He must loathe me now. He'll never look for me again. Then. what will happen to the contract? Well actually, it's good if it ends here.

A relationship with an expiration might as well let it expire early.

"Ah!"

Yuri cried out and put her hand on her forehead. She had begun to hear voices again, this happened every time she was sleep deprived. She had not slept for days together, so it was only natural to experience them now. It would begin with images constantly hounding her, followed by a voice echoing in her mind. Slowly the images would disappear, leaving behind just the voice.

She tried to block it by reading a book or watching TV, but each time she was interrupted by a constant headache. No matter what she did, she couldn't rid herself of the torture. She had lost her appetite now, eating meals were akin to a task. She carried it out mechanically, just because her body needed it.

When she held her pencil and drew to kill time, without her realizing, she would end up sketching the one face. Each time she would capture a different facade. a sober face, his angry mien. when he was focused on sex, his smile, frown. every emotion she had seen would be traced, sheet after sheet. And when she would be done, she would sit gazing at her creation for a long, long time.

A week, 7 days, 168 hours. Actually, it's been longer now?

Yuri shook, turned her head again, and thought about the meaning behind it all. Going through these motions like clockwork every day, what was the use? Where was she getting to? Her health was on a downward spiral from drug withdrawal. How much longer could she take it? Now that she wasn't getting






enough sleep, she was missing the rough sex she had with him.

She wasn't sure if she was falling asleep or losing her consciousness.

How much more devastated do you want me to feel?

The woe filled voice lingered on in her ears, tugging at her heart even now. In all honesty, she had never wanted to make him feel miserable. Instead, she was trying to conceal her own miseries from him. When he had barged in demanding an answer, she was flustered and infuriated that her most embarrassing secret had been exposed. She was desperately fumbling to cover it up and chose defiance as her shield. The truth was murky, she unkempt-how could she strip herself before him?



Funny how she wanted to appear flawless before him like something one can never achieve no matter how hard and badly one wanted it. Something that stayed in the heart, like a dream or an illusion. Just like how he was to her.

In the end, Samuel had shattered her dream to pieces, shredded the fantasy, and abruptly pulled her back to reality.

When the ringing in her ears became louder, she frantically got up from the bed. There was no way she could go to sleep tonight. She hurriedly went down to the basement, perhaps the aimless doodling would bring her some respite. If not, the ringing was sure to drive her insane.



Inexplicably, the scent of the paint and wood in the basement studio soothed her taut nerves. Yuri took a deep gulp of air, turned on the lights, and started sifting through her sketchbook. Right then, a small envelope fell to the ground from between the pages. It was something that was mixed with gifts from Samuel.









As soon as she caught sight of the envelope, Yuri instinctively knew it's the same thing from last time. She could ask Manager Choi to get rid of it but she let it stay. Maybe she wanted to remind herself that the two might be playing a couple, but in fact, their relationship was nothing more than a passing affair. No matter how pitiful it was to think about it, it was still true.



Yuri debated on whether she should open the envelope or not. As she fiddled with it, she could feel the contents, it seemed like there were photographs inside. Whoever had sent it, seemed to have a penchant for sending photos, this was the second time she was receiving one.



She had a feeling, just like last time, these photos would bring her no good. Thinking up to her, she casually ripped it open but what greeted her was beyond her imagination. she screamed her guts out.


"Wha-What is this?!"




As the stack of photos slipped from her trembling hands and scattered on the floor, the ghastliness of it lay bare. Most of them were shots of a man and a woman. They appeared to be on a date like a normal couple, except for the fact that the red lines across the woman's face made them extremely grotesque. They were all photos of herself and Samuel in Jinseong.

Ho- how. Why would anybody.?

One by one her gaze rested on the photos on the floor, each was eerier than the one before. However, her pupils widened when she noticed one particular photo. It was during her high school graduation, she and Hye-yeon were standing next to each other with their graduation caps on. Yuri looked at her young face.

<The Whore who Killed her Friend!>

"OH GOOOODDD!"

She shrieked at the offensively squiggled scarlet handwriting. She could feel a thin barrier in her head crack as she lost control of her emotions. It was frightening. Too frightening for her to handle. Her attention was drawn to her deathly silent surroundings. She was used to this creepy aura. It was happening again. She was being sucked into her thoughts as her emotions engorged and exploded.

Yuri hastily picked up the photos and ran to the library. She nervously bit on her nails as her quaking fingers inserted them into the shredder. Perhaps because the ambience was shrouded in pin-drop silence, the shredder's soft chomping felt especially loud.

As she stood there looking at the pictures going through the blades, she felt a sudden splitting pain in her head like it was her and not the pictures that were in the shredder right now. It hurt, it








hurt her so much. Her hands instinctively started looking for medication, at least her sleeping pill.

As if stimulated by the groping fingers, a spark of memory jolted her awake. Back when she had just moved into the house, she had trouble sleeping at night. When she stayed awake for three days straight, Samuel had reluctantly handed her sleeping pills. She clearly remembered they were on the shelf. Since nothing was touched in this empty house, the pills should still be there. Yuri impatiently opened the shelf.




The car had just passed the tollgate to Seoul. Four hours had passed since they had left for Busan. Jin-wook checked on Samuel through the rearview mirror. The man had drunk quite a lot in the last dinner meeting. Actually, he drank a lot during the whole 3-day trip but not to the point that it would affect his work. Even so, Jin-wook decided to stay vigilant in case the man might act out strangely.



"Where would you like to go?"

Eyes shut, Samuel rolled his body into a ball in the backseat. He didn't reply. He must still be drunk.

"Let's go home," Jin-wook said, still keeping an eye on the rear seat.



Samuel slowly opened his eyes, he must not have been asleep.

"Home?" He mumbled.

Jin-wook replied with a brief 'yes' and without waiting for an answer switched directions.









Ever since childhood, Samuel referred to the house in which he lived with his grandfather as the 'main house'. The only place he called 'home' was the house in which he stayed with Yuri Han.

When they entered the neighbourhood, Samuel ordered Jin-wook to park the car in front of the house. It was past midnight, the street had returned to tranquility. There was not a single drunk trooping around this safe neighbourhood.

The team of security guards outside the house greeted Samuel politely. Against everyone's expectation, the boss did not get out of the car. Instead, he took out a cigarette and sat there quietly.

Jin-wook rolled down the backseat window half-way. The night breeze was cold as ever but quite potent to recover from a hangover. The white smoke melted into the darkness. Samuel looked up at the house and took a deep puff. Jin-wook simply let him be.



He finally spoke up as he bit onto his second cigarette. "Reminds me of the past."

"When do you mean?"

"When Hye-yeon Jin- I mean- Yuri Han went missing."

He was saying things he normally would keep to himself. He must still be drunk. Jin-wook silently kept listening.

As for the inebriated man, he ignored the other's lack of reaction and kept talking slowly. "Before I even notice it, I always end up in front of this house. Just like now."

Jin-wook met eyes with Samuel through the rearview mirror. When it came to himself, Samuel was extremely strict. He usually slept for two to three hours only, stayed up all night at work, never took a vacation like his peers, at least not to exotic locations. These were






Director Seo's famous characteristics, a thorough workaholic was what the world viewed him as.

Guess it wasn't true tonight for Samuel, a cigarette between his fingers, whiled away his time doing nothing but gazing at the house ahead that had not a single light turned on. He seemed too afraid to enter the house that was wreathed in his marks.

As if aware of the outside situation, a light was turned on in the house. Samuel's eyes followed the light.

". It's by the library. What time is it?"

"It has just turned 3 AM. "

He frowned. "I guess she can't sleep." His murmur showed a hint of affection.

Jin-wook carefully asked him. "Aren't you going in?"

Samuel was at a loss for words for a minute. "No. Not today. I can't."

He rolled up the windows and leaned his head on the back seat.

"Let's go to the main house." When Samuel felt the movement of the car, he closed his eyes.

You don't listen to me when I don't give you consent. Do you even consider me as a human being?

I'm not your possession!

It was not like he wasn't tempted to go into the house, he did long to see her. But when her cries came rushing back to him, he turned numb. How much pain she must have been in. how savagely he








had hurt her, damaged her body. How selfish he had been. No, he didn't want to repeat the mistake.

Only he knew the kind of willpower he had to muster to rein in his impatience, change the destination of the car, and arduously try to eliminate any thoughts of going to her.








"Good morning."

The next day Samuel had just finished a lonesome breakfast when Jin-wook appeared in the dining hall. The man ordered a small coffee, which was a clear indication that he was done with his meal.


"You must have slept here." Samuel rose from his seat.

"Yes. I woke up early to play chess with the CEO." Jin-wook answered.

After he had brought the Samuel over last night, he had stayed back. Among other reasons, he wanted to be sure his friend cum boss was fine.

"That's good to hear. He refuses to play with me."

"He complains how he beats you too easily and how it gets too boring." Jin-wook replied with a smile.

Samuel shrugged. "There's no reason to win."

That meant, if there was a reason to win, he would have easily won. He was a man driven with purpose even in trifling matters, so where he didn't see one he wouldn't waste his time.

Samuel requested his coffee to be delivered to the library as he walked out of the door. Other than a brief meeting with a foreign buyer in the afternoon, he was free for the rest of the day. It was time to deal with the very thing he had been procrastinating on for a while- Yuri Han. It was his guilt all along that was hindering him from tending to the problems around her, but he knew he couldn't delay it any longer.









When Jin-wook stepped out to take a call from family, Samuel called Jin-ho.

"Look up all the available hospitals. This needs to be kept a secret to the public." He was never the one for civilities, always getting straight to the point in a terse tone.

Seoin Hospital, under the Seoin Group, was renowned for its adept surgeries and state-of-the-art facilities. The only downside was that it did not have a separate rehab clinic as such. So, anyone with access to the hospital would be privy to every patient's history. Samuel liked to keep his private matters private, even from his family. This included Yuri and especially her condition.

Jin-ho cautiously asked Samuel.

"Is it true that she did drugs?"

"Yes."

"Since when?"

"Probably back in America. It's a place full of temptations, and her job's particularly exposed to it too."

Every night in towns such as Soho or Greenwich Village in New York, folks who called themselves "artists" emerged to seek drugs.

She must also have started out of curiosity. Samuel did not want to think too much about it.

o	"I heard there's a helpful clinic in the countryside. The son of S is also a regular there.."

"No. I want it to be as close as possible."

She needed treatment without the public's attention, but he wanted her to stay by his side. She had to be by his side.






"How long does the treatment take?"

"It's very difficult to make a conclusion. The controlled substance was strong, but the antidepressive ingredient was also abusive. It was a miracle that the airport let these go. This could last long term."


Samuel lit his cigarette. So far, his effort to cut on cigarettes had turned to naught. He wished for a child. But the woman in his arms was like an illusion that would disappear any moment. He especially wished to see Yuri bear his children and give birth to babies that resembled her.



"Nothing seems to go right." Samuel swallowed his murmur with the cigarette smoke.

That's when Jin-wook returned from his phone call. He gave a detailed report as he repeated what he had heard from the ex-hotel manager the other night.

"So what does that man want in exchange?" Samuel snickered. If that man harboured thoughts of blackmailing him, then even the heavens wouldn't be able to save him.

"He wants a new position that works indoors instead of the parking lot." Jin-wook was only the messenger, whether or not the man would have his wish granted depended on this almighty devil before him.


"Let him do as he wants." Came the reply.

Jin-wook immediately got the gist of the words and said, "I'll head to Jinseong this afternoon to get the video footage."

"Is there anyone else who knows about the incident?"










Since the location was the hotel lobby, chances were more than one person knew of this. This was why Jin-wook had asked the same question to the man, besides, it also served as a good source to double-check should that man be sending them on a wild goose chase.



"Hyeon-ah Kim was in the lobby that day. She would know exactly what happened."

Hyeon-ah Kim. A charismatic face instantly appeared in his mind, the kind that made it obvious that she was not an easy person to handle.


"Did you find out about him?"

The 'him' here was the driver involved in the accident who had been released from prison two years ago. Since the cameras had all been cut off, he was the next best bet to get answers.

"Yes. Only a short while after his release, he opened a restaurant that's pretty big in his hometown. It's quite confusing. How did a man who was bankrupt prior to the accident obtain the money to open a restaurant?"


"Worth finding out."

Samuel crossed his arms and mulled the info to complete the puzzle. President Jin and In-bae Lee. What sort of thing would involve both of these individuals? Despite the significant hints, the truth had yet to reveal itself.

A call from Manager Choi broke the silence. Must be about Yuri if she's calling this early in the morning.

"What's the matter?"










"Sir, the main door is not functioning properly. She must have locked it from the inside, but she isn't responding to the doorbell."




The entrance door was protected with a security function that did not allow any trespassers into the house. It could be unlocked with a passcode usually but needed a master key if someone decided to lock it from the inside. Moreover, Samuel was the only person with the master key.



He said to hold for a moment and ended the call. Something did not seem right. He quickly got up and looked at Jin-wook.

"I must go see Yuri."

He called Yuri during his entire ride to the house. No matter how long he tried he was not connected to her. Was she sleeping

in? His watch indicated that it was past 10 AM. She did not seem to be able to sleep last night, was this why?

He tried to stay nonchalant but his anxiety only intensified with each passing moment. Jin-wook noticed Samuel's nervous face through the rearview mirror.

"You saw her awake very late at night just yesterday." He tried to remind him, in case he didn't remember because he was quite drunk.


Correct. He'd checked with his own eyes that the library had its lights turned on late at night. But he was still anxious. And what was he excessively fretting over? That Yuri might have disappeared just like in the past. His heart pounded vigorously from nervousness, his face was ashen.

Samuel firmly pursed his lips as he sank in his thoughts. The moment they arrived, he did not even give time for Jin-wook to park the car before he dashed out of the vehicle and to the house.








Manager Choi and the security guards, who were standing by the entrance, lowered their heads.

"Still no response from the inside?"

"No. I rang the doorbell a few times, but she wouldn't answer. "

Samuel pulled out the master key and unlocked the secured door.

Like mad, he sprinted upstairs and burst open Yuri's bedroom door.

The room felt eerily dark, what with its closed curtains and stuffy air. He quickly turned on the lights but saw not a soul.

Where is she?

He rushed to his bedroom, pushing the door open. As he stood there taking in the scene, he noticed a silhouette of a body covered with a blanket all the way to the face. It was a habit of hers to cover her face when she slept. When he caught sight of her hair and fingers peeking out and stroked his chest in a bid to calm his throbbing heart.



"Yuri."

As he cautiously stepped inside, the sleeping figure should've provided him a semblance of relief. Yet, his heart never ceased to race. He curled his nose at the thick stench of alcohol permeating the room. Did she drink? About then, he stepped on something and came to a halt.



He narrowed his eyes at the familiar object that he had accidentally kicked- a bottle of Booker's. This was a whiskey of over 60% alcohol concentration that was gracing the shelf in his library. Only now it was absolutely empty.

Did. did she finish this bottle by herself?










Samuel stilled before panic took over through and through. If this weak woman drank this much alcohol, she must be under the risk of acute alcohol intoxication!

Hurriedly, he tugged at the blanket veiling Yuri from head to toe. The anxiety in his voice was a testament to the turmoil of his heart at the moment.

"Yuri!" He cried aloud, hoping to wake her up.

Soon the wan face of the slumbering girl revealed from under. She lay there, dyed in a shade of blue. lifeless.

He held her by the shoulders and frantically shook her as he shouted: "Yuri Han! Wake up!"

By now, startled by the racket, Jin-wook and Manager Choi had rushed into the room.

A distraught Samuel lifted the limp girl up, her body cold. A stunned Jin-wook quickly recomposed himself as he placed his fingers on her neck. Her pulse was barely perceptible.

"Call the ambulance now!" Samuel screamed. He could feel his whole body fluster. His hands vigorously rubbed over Yuri's feet and hands, trying to induce some heat. It was the most he could do to help her keep breathing.

"What happened?" Jin-wook took out the flashlight he always carried around to check on Yuri's pupils.

Samuel shook his head. "I can't be certain, but I should say it's acute alcohol intoxication-" He paused in the midst of speaking as a silhouette of a white object on the side table grasped his attention.


It can't be!






Samuel ordered Jin-wook to look over Yuri as he picked up the object. It was a vial of sleeping pills. The pills Jin-ho prescribed to him a while back. When he opened the lid, he was thunderstruck.

The vial was. empty.




His hands trembled, Jin-ho took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He frowned at the moist sensation. He had to give up on pursuing a career in general surgery because of his inherent personality, despite getting perfect grades in school.

Doctors are expected to be inherently composed, no matter the situation adn it is especially true for surgeons. Given that, this talent medico was a contrast to his profession. He was easily overwhelmed during an emergency, losing his cool and bathing in perspiration. Every time he recalled the criticisms a professor had once showered him with, he felt bitter all over.

Save her, do whatever it takes to save her!

Samuel's desperate cry was alarming enough to make the emergency assistants and even the vice president rush over to him. Jin-ho had never seen this Seo Scion this enraged ever since befriending him. The cardiologist was also more sincere than usual as he examined the D. I (Drug Intoxication) patient meticulously.

God was on their side. The sleeping pills Jin-ho had prescribed Samuel were not that potent. Moreover, they had expired over three years ago, so the ingredients were no longer as active. One more thing they were lucky with was the fact that Yuri did not take all at once but in gaps as she gradually consumed them.

However, this did not mean that the situation was not dire. She had consumed over half a bottle of pills with a full bottle of whiskey, she would've been in fighting for life had they arrived any later.






They opened her mouth to force her to throw up and cleanse her stomach. Samuel clenched his fist the whole time he watched this process. Sucking out the drug was incomparably more painful than taking the drug. As her ferocious squirms of pain rang through the room, his fist turned white, trembling in trepidation.

A prudent Jin-wook was quick to caution the hospital staff about divulging info, the matter had to be kept under wraps at all costs.

The emergency procedure was completed and Yuri was wheeled out to another room, even then Samuel's firmly clenched fists didn't relax.


Seeing the man's stance, Jin-ho thought the actual one at risk was Samuel, not Yuri. He was pointlessly wandering around the pale woman like a ghost. The phone rang several more times but he did not even flinch.


Right then, Jin-wook ran to his boss in a frenzy and whispered. There seemed to be an emergency at work. It was only now that Samuel reluctantly recovered his sanity and took his eyes off the woman.


When he left, Jin-ho felt a humongous burden lift off his shoulders. Their treatment was a success, the woman would soon wake up and have no trouble recovering. Then, Samuel would also be relieved. At least that was what he thought until-

"Aaahh! No! Don't, don't put it inside me!"

Who would have thought that a completely unconscious woman would have a seizure?





As soon as she opened her eyes, she yanked on her cannula. The force backfired, the needle poked her vein, blood gushed out. Her frail hand was dyed crimson in no time.

A panic-stricken Jin-ho yelled for the nurses. Since Yuri had only just been purged of alcohol and toxins, even slight bleeding was extremely detrimental, it could even harm the heart. Time was of the essence, the nurses held her hands, stopping her from moving about, as the doctor instantly grabbed a vile of tranquilizer and held up the syringe. At the sight of the needle, the terrified and agitated girl's eyes glistened, so much that the man holding it turned anxious.



"No, no, no, no needles, please no!"

Her ear-piercing shriek stunned the nurses, but the seasoned staff only gripped her firmly. But a frenetic Yuri would have none of it, tugging her hand to wrest free, shoving the vital sign monitor, and pushing Jin-ho away. Her skinny body was so potent that the nurses struggled to calm her down.

After a long hustle, the nurses were ultimately able to subdue her, pinning her onto the bed. With super speed, Jin-ho quickly injected the ready syringe into her vein. She shook her head in rejection, as she burst into tears.

"Please, please stop, please-"

The drug took immediate effect, her wails eventually died down, and she closed her eyes seemingly at peace. Her limp body looked even more fragile as if it would shatter with just a light breeze.

Jin-ho let out a deep sigh as if he had just won an arduous battle. He then asked the nurses to tidy up the chaotic room.






"Wha-what is this overreaction~" Jin-ho murmured to himself as he sank his face in his palms. The fear, hatred, fury, and instability reflected in the woman's eyes at the sight of the needle was too stressful even in hindsight. As a doctor had seen his fair share of people with a fear of needles, but this girl's was beyond extreme.

Jin-ho pulled up his glasses and exhaled audibly. He gazed at the wan form on the bed, monitoring her diligently. He couldn't afford a lapse of judgment at this stage, not just because he feared Samuel's demonic aura, but also because he was a sincere doctor.

After some waiting, with his heart in his mouth, the vital signs gradually turned stable again. It was only now that he noticed how bony Yuri's arm was. Because of this, they had to administer the intravenous through her hand instead of the wrist.



"What's wrong with her wrist?"

When Jin-ho came back after discussing some matters regarding Yuri with the vice president, Samuel was already back in the room. Did he deal with that mandatory meeting well before he came back here so quickly?


Samuel had long noticed the doctor's arrival but still locked his eyes on the pale woman.

"She had a seizure in the middle."

"A seizure?" He turned his body in surprise.

Jin-ho was intimidated by Samuel's expression. The man who was always apathetic portrayed a strong feeling of concern on his face.


"?She's mentally very unstable. Did something happen?"







Samuel did not reply instead turned his head towards Yuri again. Jin-ho could sense an aura of both fury and ambivalence from the man. Was he furious because he was ambivalent, or was he ambivalent because he was furious? The emotions behind his straight facade seemed to be boiling wildly inside him.

"Leave, I want some peace." He sounded hostile but also sincere.

Jin-ho thought it best not to provoke the man and quietly left the room. It was the only room in the VIP area so things were super quiet here. As he stepped out, he found Jin-wook waiting for him in the hallway. He beckoned the doctor.

"Bro."

This was how Jin-ho usually called Jin-wook. Because of their age gap, Jin-wook seemed more like a father than a brother to the other. Well, he did take care of him instead of their deceased parents, so it was reasonable to think that way.

"How's the condition?" he asked solemnly.

"Who are we talking about? Samuel or the girl?" Jin-wook replied gravely.

"The girl."

"We've detoxified the drug. She had a seizure in the middle of it, but she's doing much better now. Her health has overall weakened. She needs more examinations done."

"She had a seizure?" Jin-wook was surprised.

"She went berserk at the sight of the needle. I'm not a psychology major, but I assume it's a typical reaction of PTSD patients. It was serious actually. I think it's due to her memory loss. You had a hard time from it back in the day too. You even had to quit your job as a






police officer." The man reminded his older brother as he gazed at him and let out a sigh.
