.



However, Samuel, who was in a superb mood today, happily lent his card to the employees. Needless to say, the people of this department were on cloud nine. They took their time enjoying the rare meal, all except Manager Lee who finished his meal quickly and returned to the office.



It was there that he heard Samuel talking over the phone with someone. The door that was usually shut tight, was ajar. Thanks to this, Manager Lee discovered that his cold boss could also speak in the most affectionate way.

Was it a woman? It won't be his fiancée of course. Argh, what was he thinking?!














When the car entered the parking lot, Manager Song of the Song Boutique was already waiting to greet him. She welcomed Samuel inside.


"Manager Yoon is already in the fitting room."

"How many outfits did she choose?" he asked.

"She has chosen six."

Samuel looked at his watch to calculate the time. "Might take about half an hour. I'll get changed later."

He didn't like shopping. He hired a professional shopper to get all of his outfits for official meetings. Song, whom he had worked with for the past three years, was talented enough to please him every time. Today's suit was also a match to his taste.

"Then I'll notify you when it's time."

Samuel normally looked through papers or made business calls while Si-yeon got dressed. So, Song ordered an assistant to lead him to a private room.

"Actually, I want to look around."

"Pardon?" Manager Song was genuinely surprised.










Samuel's gorgeous face frowned. "Do I need to repeat myself?"

"I apologize. Is it a gift? May I see the profile??"

Usually, Samuel would hand Song a profile of the woman when he was looking for a gift. Then, Song would choose something befitting and gift wrap it. She would diligently save all of the profiles she was handed on her tablet so as to avoid recommending the same outfits in the future.



The young director would usually prepare gifts for his aunts and female cousins, or important women in his business. This time, his fiancée Si-yeon was added to that list.

Samuel stopped Song, who was going through the previous profiles.

"It's fine; I'll choose myself."

The boutique manager's fingers involuntarily slid off the tablet screen. Choose by himself? What she heard was simply unbelievable. A person who would not even choose his own outfits wants to choose a gift for someone else?

Song tried her best to keep her polite smile on and not reveal the shock in her heart. "Of course. This way please."

But it seemed like today was the day when Manager Song's emotions would be put to test and how. Before she could recompose herself from the initial shock, the man carelessly tossed her into a maze. The clothes he was choosing right now, to be precise the feminine pencil skirt or the long flared dress, weren't meant for a petite woman with a glamorous body figure like Si-









yeon's. Rather they did justice to the slender and tall ones with a fashion-model like figure.

When was it? She remembered the clothes Samuel bought one day. Early in the morning he had randomly summoned her to his office and handed her a shopping bag with heels and clothes, and asked her to come back in an hour with an outfit, innerwear, and heels of the same size. That was the first time Samuel ordered her to do so in three years.



The clothes back then were also for a woman of the same body type.



Samuel meticulously scoured over ten outfits, four pairs of heels, three bags, and even lingerie. In the end, he said to wrap them up in a gift box and he would send people over to collect it.

He spent so much money during his thirty minutes shopping, but there was not a trace of vexation or displeasure. Pure delight laced his handsome visage, with excitement lingering on. However, that excitement disappeared as soon as he saw a decked up Si-yeon walking out.



Manager Song escorted the pair of VIPs and wrapped the outfits Samuel had chosen.

Just then, one of the employees hurried over to the boss with a query. "Manager, the Louboutins Mr. Seo chose a few minutes ago are out of size 36. We only have size 38 left. Should I contact the S
Department Store for the same design?"

Si-yeon wore a size 36. The good employee who helped Si-yeon get dressed seemed to have remembered this and diligently brought the matter over to the boss. It would be embarrassing for the company to make any kind of mistake, to say nothing of an important thing such a size.






However, Song shook her head. "No, size 38 is correct."

"Pardon? But-"

"Haven't I told you not to be overly interested in a customer's privacy? If a word about this gets out, we're all doomed."

The employee was discouraged at the unjust reprimand. That woman was a size 38. Who was that woman? Was she a celebrity? A model? Song forgot about how she just berated her employee for being nosy and shook her legs from curiosity.

The art center where the ceremony was held was illuminated with fancy lights. Samuel and Si-yeon got out of the car, and their assistants led them inside.

The hall was already crowded with people. When the two entered the room, they had the attention of every eyeball there was. The couple's wealth and beauty were more than enough to enrapture those in attendance. They were a match made in heaven.

Su-Kwang Lee greeted them with the widest smile. "You are very welcome here. How's your grandfather, Director Seo?"

"He's doing very well. Thanks for asking." Samuel replied coldly.

"When's the wedding?" The cheery ex-politician asked, not at all minding the bland replies

"It's going to be next year." Another dull reply.

"The chairman must be very pleased. He's always wanted great-grandchildren." Su-Kwang Lee laughed excitedly.

Samuel and Si-yeon shared a few pleasantries with him and walked around the hall to say hello to the others. Everyone they greeted mentioned their wedding. Samuel knew they did not take






their upcoming nuptials seriously and rather treated it as fat meat of gossip. Not that he cared about his own marriage, but the idea of being the butt of their sadistic pleasure, didn't sit well with him.

When they'd finally walked around the entire hall greeting and meeting, something caught his attention. With great flair and fan following in came the presidential hopeful, In-Bae Lee. With a bright grin, he vigorously shook hands with Su-Kwang Lee. From time to time, laughter erupted from the small circle formed around the two men.



Samuel's cold, gimlet eyes trailed the man's every movement. How he spoke, his mannerism and every bit of detail was registered in his mind.

"I heard he is to be appointed as an official candidate. He seems to have a very strong support base." Si-yeon whispered to Samuel.

"I see." His tone was non-committal, concealing well his thoughts.

"I heard Kook Noh is a strong candidate for the opposing party."

She added.

"He's not influential enough to be a rival." He replied.

"I agree with you, but we never know. There is still time until the election."

They had known each other since childhood, but there was only one thing the two had in common- objective outlook. In that, they were identical: weighing their pros and cons, meticulously choosing their friends and foes, and never giving in to their impulse. Though young, they had never let their emotions come in the way of making a decision. Well, whether the duo even possessed emotions, was entirely another matter. As such,










when they tied the knot, there was little wonder they would make the perfect pair of business partners. But that was it.

Right then, Su-Kwang Lee beckoned the would-be's over. He introduced In-bae Lee to them with great gusto.

In-bae offered a handshake with a kind smile. "It's an honor to meet the hottest couple of the year. I've met Ms. Yoon before, but it's my first time seeing you, Mr. Seo. You really do resemble Chairman Seo in his early years. "

"It's an honor to meet you. I've heard a lot about you from Myeong-je Jin. I heard you two were close friends." Samuel looked at the man in the eye and delivered his greetings.













In-bae Lee was startled at the mention of Myung-je Jin. Nevertheless, he kept a straight face like a seasoned politician that he was. "Oh, didn't Seoin take over Hotel Jinseong? Hotel Jinseong is too famous for me to not care about Mr. Jin," he said, deftly painting his connection to the deceased man as a passing acquaintance.



"Was that so? I guess it doesn't matter anymore since he's already dead." Samuel firmly grabbed In-bae Lee's hand and added. "I expect you to use your people wisely, especially with an election coming up soon. My grandfather has very high expectations. Me as well."



In-bae's face stiffened looking at the retreating back of the young man.



All the information that Samuel had been given so far were inconclusive. He knew there was a lot of foul play involved, but he had yet to learn who the culprits were. He didn't know how and if

In-bae Lee and Yuri Han were connected. With his words just now, he hoped the man felt threatened enough and behaved properly.

The tension was building, Si-yeon quickly changed the topic.

"How was your break?"

"Did I tell you I was on break?" he said coldly.

"Several people told me. What did you do during your break?" she asked, ignoring his frosty tone.

"I rested."

"You didn't go hunting this time?" she asked, surprised.








"I did a while ago." He shrugged.

"A while ago. when?" Si-yeon was puzzled. She didn't remember him doing so. And it was highly unlikely that she would be mistaken because this man's hunting trips were not something one could forget.


Right then Samuel's phone vibrated. When he saw that it was Jin-ho calling, he looked at Si-yeon and said, "I'm going to answer this one."


"Okay." Si-yeon nodded and headed to the catering corner.

Samuel went to the balcony where he was the lone occupant and answered the call as he took out his cigarette. "What is it?"

"Are you available to talk?"

"Not for too long. Just get to the point.

"I've found out the composition of the medication."

"What's it?

"Ummm-" Jin-ho hesitated.

Was it a strong one? He thought of how Yuri would have very painful headaches from time to time. Samuel didn't urge the doctor and waited for his response.

"It's Kratom."

"? Kratom? That's a drug."

"Yes, it's a drug. It's not FDA approved, but it's sometimes used for treatment in America to kill pain or treat drug addiction. Samuel, Samuel Seo. Are you listening?"




































Yuri organized the photos and the papers and hid them inside a drawer, making sure they were out of sight.

"You don't have to worry about that." She murmured to herself as she slammed it shut.

That's right, this was not on her, definitely, she was not to be blamed. She didn't seek the man, it was the other way around. She wanted to make a clean break, but it was he who lured her into it. taking her tablet, tossing her a contract. It was Samuel who was always threatening and locking her up, not the other way around. She was only going to stay around him until she recovered her memories. It would only last a month or two. She would leave way before his wedding, she would be far far away from the man. This was all temporary.



She irritatedly brushed her fingers through her hair and held onto her pencil again. Her croquis was 90 percent complete. It illustrated a man hugging a woman. She could not help but think of Si-yeon as she worked on the facial features. The man who embraced her so passionately would now do the same to Si-yeon. The same penis that shoved its way inside of her would now be greedy for Si-yeon's body.



Yuri could not handle it anymore. Huffing and gasping, she threw the pencil in her hand and mercilessly shredded the paper into pieces. Her work, after months and months of inspiration, now nothing but trash, lay scattered around her. Running her fingers through her tresses, she tugged at them as if doing so would pull her out of the emotional whirlpool she was in right now.

At that moment, her phone on the table rang wildly. She took a deep sigh and reached to check on the caller. It was her uncle. It







was early in the morning in New York, the time when he usually woke up to work out at the gym.

The day before, Yuri had left him a voicemail regarding her visit and her father's belongings. So, he must be calling about it. Yuri adjusted her voice to hide her emotions as she answered the call.

"Hello, Uncle."

"I just saw your message. You're leaving Korea tomorrow?"

"I am. I'll call you once I get there."

"Is Roy coming with you?"

"No, Roy's currently in Japan, and I'm only visiting temporarily. You have father's belongings, right?"

"Everything that the police found is in the storage. Everything else was thrown away when I went to Korea to get rid of the house. Why are you looking for them all of a sudden?"

"I'll tell you in person. This isn't something to talk about through the phone."

"Did you remember something?"

She noticed that his voice elevated with excitement.

"Yes, but not entirely."

A groan sounded from the other end.

He would be really shocked when he hears more about Father's death. Yuri thought to herself as she cautiously mentioned the name in case he was aware of it.









"By the way Uncle, do you happen to recognize the name "Sang-gu Park" in connection to Father's accident?"

"Of course I do. How can I not? He witnessed your father's accident. He's the guy who said your father ran into the car."

"Witnessed?"

Yuri was shocked beyond words.

That bitch is fierce and tiresome. Like father, like daughter.

It's him! The one who tried to kill me and murdered Hye-yeon!

She could feel her pulse racing as she tried to remember something about him. A headache started to surface, Yuri groaned.

"Yuri! What is it? Are you okay?"

"Huh? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just. just a little shocked."

"How do you know that name?"

"He's relevant to my incident ."

"What?!"

"Uncle, you do know what he looks like, right? I can't talk for long; my head is aching badly. I'll tell you all about it once I get there."

"Of course, I'll wait for you."

After hanging up, Yuri restlessly lay her body on the sofa. Her head was throbbing, she was in excruciating pain. she felt as if someone was piercing her head with a nail. She glared at the shredded remains of the paper. She was so mad that her head








was aching. Her eyes welled up with tears, she was fighting hard to endure.

Why is it hurting so much.

Unable to hold it any longer, Yuri impatiently took out a pill with her trembling hands, walked to the kitchen to fetch a cold glass of water to swallow it with. Then she sat at the table massaging her temples.


It's okay. Everything will be fine. She was reassuring herself when.

SLAM!

? The main door closed with a racket. Yuri immediately stood up to check who it was only to see Samuel barging towards her.

"You said you're going to be late."

A frosty, maniacal Samuel bored his hawkeyes into her. The man stood there in silence, dropping the temperature in the room to the subzero level. But when his gaze landed on the pill vial sitting neatly on the table, he grabbed it, fiercely thrashing it on the floor. The clear plastic vial shattered upon impact, the capsules scattered in all directions.



"What do you think you're doing!"













This was the first time Yuri was witnessing Samuel's violent streak. The man was brutish at times, but such belligerence was uncharacteristic of him. This whole situation. the ear-piercing noise, the shattered vial. everything was absolutely unbelievable.

She stood there in a daze, eyes fixated on the ground unable to process the whole situation. Her heart was racing, head throbbing, hands numb, lips quivering. but she was oblivious to it all.

Samuel's cold, low voice broke the eerie silence.

"You did it?"

How could a person's voice be this low? Simply looking at him was intimidating enough for her to freeze and stick to the floor. The sparks from his stare were powerful enough to annihilate anything.

The aura he was emanating made him look almost inhumane.

Akin to a ghost or a goblin.

All of this combined and effected a delayed reaction in Yuri.

"Sorry?" Was the only word she managed to mumble in her befuddlement. She did not know why this man had come barging in like a towering inferno. She was afraid to make eye contact even, but she still looked at him.

"How dare you treat your body like that!" His terrifying tone sent chills down her spine, her eyes shook intensely.

"You dare to do drugs?!" He bellowed.

"How did you."

It can't be. She could feel her own fingertips tremble.









"I looked up the ingredients to that medication you're taking! It has Kratom in it!"

Yuri could feel her brain vault into malfunction and come to a grinding halt. Words evaded her, she could see nothing but the deadly stare of the devilish man before her.

"I think I made it clear not to lie to me, and you dare to keep this a secret?" His foot crushed the capsules lying on the floor.

Yuri zoned into the mashed capsules bleeding out white granules. He was still in his fancy tuxedo. He must have rushed out of the party, all because of this.

"Tell me. Explain yourself to me. Give me the whole story. Tell me the bare details with your own mouth!!!"

He grabbed a handful of her hair and forced eye contact. His demanding, fierce countenance looked somewhat desperate for a wholehearted explanation. His eyes were searching her face, seeking a hint perhaps, that would say it was all a misunderstanding. His heart tugged, knowing too well

that that trace of hope he was yearning for was but a delusion.

His tight grip was no doubt painful, but she was feeling none. Her limpid, glistened orbs only noticed the black, bespoke tuxedo that was glaringly reminding her of the engagement photos she had just put away. An engagement that would soon become a marriage.



Two decades of friendship into love. He must be returning from some party he had been to with Si-yeon.

So why does he care about me so much?!.











As moments passed, his grip tightened. Slowly her mind crawled back to reality, she took in a deep breath willing herself to feel no pain. Not once did she avert her gaze, looking equally fiercely into his eyes.


"What do you want me to say more? It's just the way you know. I did drugs. So what? And what does that have to do with you?"

Her mind was racing, everything between them was a contract. she was an object that Samuel Seo had bought along with Hotel Seoin. What did it matter to him if she did drugs or anything else? The tenure was about to expire anyway. They would be done, for good.



Her words incensed him, he pulled her hair as if doing so would rein in her audacity. "What does that have to do with me? You think this isn't a big deal?" He spat out with gritted teeth.

"Of course not!"

"We're just friends with benefits who enjoy having sex with each other, so there's nothing else that matters? Is that what you mean?" Samuel's visage portrayed a merciless shadow. His voice had a hint of the fury he could not withhold.

Did his fury trigger her? Yuri began to develop an emotion similar to his. She had arduously tried her best to ignore the fact that he held her uncle and Roy hostage, stalked her every move, and spied on her. She had lied to him too, so she wanted to call it even. But she never imagined that he would be so nosy even about her prescription medications.



Her life felt already ruined. But how much worse did he want to make it? How dare he? She could not tolerate the storming anger inside her.









"How are we even called friends with benefits? You don't listen to me when I don't give you consent. Do you even consider me as a human being? You cage me, question me, watch me! Do you know how miserable it is to see Sebastian in the living room? There's nothing different between me and that dog you stuffed by yourself! I'm not your possession!"



Samuel picked a glass and threw it across the hall.

Crack!

The loud shattering of glass filled the room with an eerie silence once again. Yuri flinched at the sight of the glass hitting the wall and breaking into pieces.









Thanatos, in Greek mythology, was the personification of death. Merciless and indiscriminate, he was hated by mortals and gods alike.


The doctor before Davis looked at Yuri pathetically as he counseled about this God of Death. Unfortunately, his counseling was no help whatsoever. At least she had never felt a desire for Thanatos: self-destruction or death.

It's a popular prognosis that those with suicidal tendencies also suffer from attention deficit syndrome or ADS. In severe cases, in a bid to garner attention, the patient resorts to self-infliction of pain. Slicing of the wrist, swallowing a handful of sleeping pills, etc, are a few of the common methods towards the same.

However, Yuri had no such desire. Attention and death were never on her mind. If anything, she just wanted a chance to really relax. She wanted her head to stop aching, for those dreams that kept tormenting her to disappear, to get some deep, undisturbed sleep.

The doctor had been wrong from the start- the one she truly desired was Thanatos' twin brother Hypnos, God of Sleep.

And yet, she could swear that now was the only time she had ever wanted self-destruction and death. Right now, at this moment, the moment she met Samuel Seo's eyes.

She felt a strong desire to become the vial that was thrashed by his hand, the pill that was mashed by his foot, or the glass that shattered into pieces. It was due to these morbid emotions that were surging within her that she had said the words that she should have kept to herself.










"Does it annoy you that your Barbie doll is a drug addict? Does it disgust you that you made out with such filth?" She sniggered, looking at the man the world touted as Mr. Perfect in the eye.

Would he be considered as tainted now? Because of her.

Samuel's face turned whiter than a sheet and stiffer than a mannequin. He fiercely gripped her chin.

"What did you just say?"

Although those were the words, his eyes were saying otherwise.

One more word and he'd kill her.

Yuri's chin was so firmly grasped that she was unable to open her mouth. She gazed at him, incessantly gasping.

"I've never thought of you that way and I never had the means to mistreat you. Nonetheless, if that's what you want, I guess why not."

His voice was agonizing, eyes seething with anger. He was thoroughly provoked, losing all sense of reason.

Samuel pulled Yuri to the living room and shoved her onto the couch. The force was so great that she felt pain even though she had landed on a soft surface.

He straddled on top of her and pressed on the slender body trying so hard to escape. He pushed his hand up her dress, yanked

her underwear stripping her down naked to open her legs wide. Her lady parts twitched at the sudden coldness as the man savagely unbuckled his belt and pulled down his pants.

Yuri became pale as a ghost.

"Wh-what do you think you're doing?!"










Obviously she was not wet at all. She was actually awkward and stiff from her agony and nervousness. However, Samuel's reaction was absolutely unsympathetic and hostile. He looked as if he was possessed by a fiendish madness that would heed to nothing and no one.



"Shut up! Didn't you want to be treated this way?" He forced her knees wide and penetrated at once.

"Ow!" Yuri whimpered in pain and abruptly twisted her body.

His eager fondling was not enough to ease the pain

of penetration. Nevertheless, she was at a loss of words when he attacked her without even a notice. The pain was breathtaking. Veins popped up as she clenched on the couch.

"Open up completely." He ordered.

Then, seizing her thighs that were wreathed with marks made by his lips, he mercilessly shoved his manhood all the way through. He strenuously twisted his shaft inside of the narrow dry tunnel.

Yuri flinched and bit her lips. The painful workout ultimately made her wet and slippery. When it became smoother for him to move, he grasped her hips and thrust forcefully.

Was this also sex? All she could feel was hot flesh pushing and pulling inside her. Ironically, her head, blood, and heart felt numb. frozen.


This wasn't like any of the times she had had so far. In that, she would be seething from head to toe, there would not be an inch of her body inside and outside, that wasn't being driven to a frenzy.

So much so, that at times she was worried she would lose herself from such great heat.








No matter how exhausting or demanding those times had been, they were never this horrible. Not even the time when she was pulled into Samuel's arms after she had lost her memories felt this appalling. This act of pleasure had turned into abuse, a nightmare. gone was the intimacy and euphoria that it usually brought along. She let the beast in him unleash its wrath, control her every move while she lay there limp, benumbed like a broken, lifeless doll.


  









"fucking hell!" Samuel cussed out loud as he was upset about everything.

The man was in a treacherous limbo. A part of him was trying to dissuade and stop himself, fighting to bring back the trace rationality that was still lingering somewhere. But the rampant brutishness was impossible to restrain, overpowering him it surged until it reached a delirium that was out of his bounds.

He pushed on her legs and pierced her from above, stabbing her womb with his shaft. Yuri desperately held in her moan, lying woodenly enduring his madness.

They were still dressed. The only thing audible was their clothes brushing against each other's. No sounds of pleasure were heard, no sighs or groans. Apart from the hand grabbing onto her to keep her from escaping, the only thing that was directly touching her body was his rod. The typical kisses, fondling, and cooing was all absent today.



Also absent were sense and sanity, paving the way to an endless misery that was rapidly closing in on them at the moment, pushing them into its bottomless abyss.

On his part, it seemed like Samuel was hell-bent on showing Yuri what 'mistreatment' was actually like. Her words had thoroughly roiled him, to an extent he even felt wronged, so he chose the method he did as retribution.

As for her, she knew that against her better judgement, she had unleashed the demon and had to bear the brunt of it. She neither fought nor evaded it, letting it bury her.










Pain has strange ways. Sometimes, it is not only the recipient who is plagued by it. As pain seeped deep through the touching bodies, the one punishing and the one being punished were both crying in agony. All that could be wanted was for time to pass. And yet, time ticked the slowest in these torturous moments.

Yuri was incessantantly swinging around the couch when her eyes met Sebastian's. The glass eyes of the taxidermied dog, unfiltered, reflected the mess she was. Her heart tugged, courage gradually abandoned her. She didn't want to see it. She didn't want to face the reality. She firmly shut her eyes as if doing so would obliterate the truth.



The manhood that was pushing and pulling gradually engorged. It'll be over soon. She tried to relieve herself. However, instead of ejaculating, Samuel grabbed her hair and stood up.

Her eyes flew wide open at his spontaneous action. At that moment, something hot was squirted onto her face. What the. she was blank for a second.

It took her some time to realize that the sour liquid on her eyebrow was his seed. Samuel's face was indifferent unlike someone who had just finished having sex. He coldly looked down upon her.

"Open up!" He spoke between gritted teeth.

Yuri could not dare to predict his intention. The fact that he had come on her face and treated her so insolently was enough to make her nauseous. The hot rod right in front of her eyes was still dripping with semen.

Blatantly disregarding her reaction, Samuel pressed her chin with one hand. Unable to endure the pressure, her mouth involuntarily opened. He immediately pushed his cock between her lips.








"Oh. oooop!"

The man's heat and scent made it cumbersome to catch a breath.

Not only did he squirt to fill her entire mouth, but also poked the deepest part of her throat. He did not let go of her hair even when she struggled to spit it out.

"Lick it! Entirely!"

It was a command. Yuri shook her head desperately to signal that it was too much for her to handle, but he ruthlessly ignored it all and kept putting pressure on her head.

"You acknowledge yourself that you have no choice."

His glare had never been this threatening. She reluctantly licked his organ with her tongue. The thing that was inside her only a few minutes ago tasted sweet and erotic. Only after she had licked and swallowed all of the come did he withdraw his shaft from her mouth.



She desperately panted for air and vomited out a wild cough. Meanwhile, nonchalantly, he cleaned his clothes erasing all the remaining hints of sex.

"How more devastated do you want me to feel?"

The murmur to himself was suffused with grief. She thought she was the one speaking the words.

Without as much as a glance at the woman who was lying motionlessly on the floor, he walked across the living room, yanking the door loudly open and shutting it with the loudest bang.

Yuri straightened up and looked in the direction the man had left. She did not feel like standing up or even wiping her mouth. .







A significant amount of minutes later, she finally burst into tears. She was clearly the victim, nevertheless, she felt as if she had inflicted equal amount of pain she had received on Samuel.







What's going on?

Jae-won was left with questions after his phone call with Si-yeon. He'd said he'd be back after he took a call. but had just disappeared.


Si-yeon has said Samuel and her were at Su-kwang Lee's conference, a prominent figure in the world of politics without a question. Because of the upcoming election, a number of candidates were attending the meeting as were these two scions.

All of a sudden Samuel had stood up and excused himself on the pretext of a phone call. Since he didn't return even after the event had drawn to a close, left with no choice at the man's abrupt exit, Si-yeon had covered for him with a logical excuse.

How could he leave in the middle of such a vital event? What the hell's going on?! Did something major happen at work?

No matter how hard he thought, he couldn't come up with a plausible answer for his cousin's uncharacteristic behaviour. It was not like he understood Samuel completely, but he knew him well enough to know that he wouldn't cast aside important work and walk out like he had.



In the end, he simply threw up his hands and decided to tidy up the place to go home when the phone rang. It was a call from the bar manager. He checked the clock, it was nearing midnight. The bar was still open but was he thinking straight to contact an executive at this late in the night? Jae-won was bewildered as he answered the phone.



"What is it?"









"I apologize for bothering you late at night, Director Lee, are you still at the office?"

"I was just about to leave." Jae-won replied as he pushed his arm into his jacket sleeve. He was taking night shifts to work on planning for the Food and Beverage Festival next month.

The manager's relieved voice sounded.

"If you haven't gone home yet would you mind going to the private room to check on Director Seo?"

Hotel Seoin did not have a director, so the director, in this case, had to be his cousin, Samuel Seo. Why was he at such a random place?


"Is Director Seo there with you?" Jae-won asked in a trice.

"Yes. He's quite drunk."

According to Si-yeon, it was 5 hours since he had burst out of his seat. How long has he been drinking?

Jae-won frowned as he put on the rest of the jacket. Down at the hotel bar, the manager was waiting for him in front of the elevator.

"Where is he?" he asked walking out of the lift.

"He's in the VIP room located all the way down the hallway."

"Is he by himself?"

The manager nodded. "Yes, nobody came along. Not even a visitor."

Well, if Samuel had anyone along with him, he wouldn't have received a call at this time of the night.







The manager led him to the VIP room. He knocked without expecting an answer and opened the door right away. This was an action that would most definitely follow with a severe consequence, but the man inside the room was way too dazed. maybe even completely unconscious.



Not far from what he had expected to see, but Jae-won's jaw still dropped in awe. The smell of alcohol and smoke stung his nose, as it fogged up the private room that could hold at least thirty people. And in the centre of it all was a man, with the aura of an emperor, sloshed and sprawled on the table.

"How much did he drink? He couldn't have possibly drunk all of those on the table?"

The manager sincerely shook his head. "There should be a few more bottles on the floor."

Jae-won nearly cussed out loud.

Is he out of his mind?!




The dimly lit room, shrouded in cigarette haze and suffused with the stench of alcohol, looked nothing like the plush VIP room befitting the scion of Seoin Group. Right now, there was little difference between here and a lowly bar. And sprawled on the table, surrounded by god knows how many empty bottles on the table as well as the floor, the man that Korea held in awe and reverence made for a startling centrepiece.



Samuel had a high tolerance for alcohol. This was proudly ingrained in his blood and who better than Jae-won to vouch for it. How many times this fellow beat him and his father in a drinking








battle? It would not be an exaggeration to say his cousin was the personification of the phrase 'drink like a fish'.

Thus, it was unimaginable how much Samuel drank to be so out of control. It was as if he drank more alcohol than elephant water.

"How long has it been? You should've called me before he got THIS wasted." Jae-won chastised the manager.

"He didn't drink for long. An hour or two maybe. You know how the director drinks up to six hours when he's in the mood." The manager offered a meek explanation.

If it was so, then something must have pissed him off real hard. If he emptied all of these bottles in just two hours, he must've chugged the alcohol directly from the bottles. It wasn't unexpected, but it was hard to picture. One doesn't get pissed off because one simply wants to. Most essentially, he was a man who got everything he wanted.



Jae-won shook Samuel several times, then gave up and ordered the manager to get an employee to help move him to the suite. The fellow was still as a corpse the whole time he was moved into the room and on the bed.

Who would have thought there would come a day when the boss of all drinking contests would lie like this. All alone in the room, Jae-won sighed as he noticed the careless creases on the bespoke tuxedo his cousin was wearing.

"What did I do to deserve such a plight? I can't go home, instead I'm taking clothes off of this grown-ass man!" Jae-won grumbled as he headed to Samuel's closet to hang his clothes for him.

Right then, his hands holding the hanger stilled; there was a whisper from the direction of the passed out man.






Samuel in his limbo seemed to have called out a name.

Huh? Did I hear that correctly?








Jae-won froze, it was a good few seconds before he regained his senses. He first hung Samuel's clothes, took out two water bottles from the refrigerator and placed them near his cousin's head. It was an act of kindness in case he woke in the middle of the night due to thirst. After that, without an extra glance at the unconscious man, he turned off the lights and strode out of the suite.

"Are you heading home? Should I contact the driver?" The manager on his night shift noticed Jae-won and greeted him courteously.


"I forgot something at the office. I'll take care of the driver. "

Jae-won returned to his office with a stiffened expression and turned on the computer. He booted the program and typed in the security code. Then, he recklessly opened up a file. He found what he was looking for. He let out a small cry at the name that popped up on the screen.



"Oh my goodness!"

He roughly rubbed his face with his dry hands. Suddenly everything started to make sense: every inconceivable thing Samuel had done finally made sense.

The file that Jae-won was looking at was a list of guests who had canceled their hotel reservation. It had to be here. The name that Samuel called for when he was drunk. that name had to be here.


[Yuri Han.]

The name that he called out so sorrowfully and intimately. wreathed in such pain.









Late at night, Jin-wook poured soju for a man at an old bar nearby.

"How's work? Is it doable"

The man receiving the drink was an ex-manager of Hotel Jinseong, and current valet parking employee of Hotel Seoin. He was the man who recognized Yuri Han from the picture.

"It's getting difficult to work since I'm becoming old. But what other choice do I have? My first-born just started college a year behind. The youngest just started freshman year in high school."

He replied with a depressed voice.

"Oh, I'm sorry to hear, but I also understand how you're feeling. My youngest is also in high school," Jin-wook said calmly.

And thus, the two men nonchalantly chatted about life and other important things as they drank. Jin-wook decided to get to the point when the bottle was almost empty.

"Driver Su-won Han. What was he like as a person?"

"You mean Mr. Han? To be exact, Mr. Han was called a 'driver,' but actually, he wasn't someone who should be working under others. He graduated from a prestigious college, you see, and he even owned a business in Seoul." There was a degree of respect in his voice, and he truly meant every word of praise.

Jin-wook was a little surprised. Throughout his research so far, this was something he hadn't come across. He had assumed the man would be an ordinary blue collar at the most, surely not a learned one.


"Then why did he work as a driver for President Jin?" he asked.









A graduate from an ordinary college could easily find a white collar job to say nothing of people like Su-won Han who had passed out of prestigious college. So, this man had chosen to toil for a scum like Myung-je Jin when he could be sitting in a posh office in a business suit.



"The two were neighbourhood friends since childhood. I heard Han borrowed quite some money from Jin when he was expanding his business and his wife got ill. Later, he even took out loans under
Jin's name. Jin was a President, but he wasn't a brainy one. All he knew was how to order gangsters to break a few things here and there. So when the business expanded, he wanted a person he could trust and rely on, but someone he could look down upon at the same time."



"And that was Mr. Han." Jin-wook concluded in the end.

"You can put it that way."

The man ordered another bottle of alcohol and opened the lid. Jin-wook who was busy jotting down in a small notebook popped a question.


"How well do you know of Mr. Han's accident?"

"Just as much as the newspaper articles. It did seem quite odd, though. Mr. Han never drank typically because he didn't know when President Jin would call for him. But a man like him ran towards a car intoxicated-"

"Did you see Mr. Han on the day of the accident by any chance?"

Jin-wook probed.

"The day of the accident? To be frank, Mr. Han had gone missing a few days before the incident. There was someone else driving President Jin around."






This was news, nowhere had he come across this. And needless to say, the seeds of doubts were sprouting. Jin-wook dug in.

"What has happened?"

"Well, he had quite a big argument with President Jin."

"Because of what?"

The man was more than willingly chirping the whole story non-stop when suddenly, he shut his mouth like a clam. A puzzled Jin-wook stared at the man.

The man awkwardly tried to change the topic. "Working outdoors is so cumbersome now that I'm an old man. I would like to switch to a position that works inside of the hotel before the weather gets any colder."


The man's intentions were obvious. He was expecting a reward for helping. Well, there are no free lunches, and who better than the cadaver dog Jin-wook to know it best? He simply nodded in assent.


"That would depend on what you are able to give me. Do you have anything special you would like to share with me?"

The man's eyes glistened as he happily noticed an opportunity. He said slyly, "I have the security camera footage of President Jin and

Mr. Han arguing in the hotel lobby. To be honest, Jin had told me to delete it, but I kept a backup just in case. Now that Jinseong Construction is out of business and Jin dead, I thought it had become irrelevant, but like they say nobody knows what the future holds." He smiled in satisfaction apparently basking in self-praise on being insightful.












"I'll make sure to report it to the executives. I don't have the right to make decisions about the reward by myself." Jin-wook stated matter-of-factly.


"Hope to hear from you."

As an afterthought, Jin-wook asked, "By any chance, is there anyone else who knows about the argument between President Jin and Mr. Han?"

"Hyeon-ah Kim." The man muttered a name and looked up. "Right, she should know about it. That day, I was late to work because my shift started in the afternoon. I got a hang of what was going on only after I watched the security camera footage. The person in charge of the lobby was Hyeon-ah Kim that day."

Hyeon-ah Kim. Jin-wook cringed as the face of a woman with a kind smile and hidden intentions appeared in his mind. She was a woman he could not predict even after years of working with all sorts of people.


The man emptied the last glass and got up from his seat.

Something felt very strange. He didn't expect things to become so serious when he initially started his search for Yuri Han. Looking at how things were panning, even a veteran investigator like him couldn't help wonder- What was at the end of all this?







The next morning Jin-wook was summoned to Samuel's office. Just as he was stepping out of the elevator, he bumped into

Manager Choi right in front of the director's office.

Jin-wook was familiar with Manager Choi, as she had worked for Samuel for quite a few years. He also knew that she was to accompany Yuri Han to America.

Isn't she supposed to be on the plane right now? Then why is she standing here?

Unable to hold in his curiosity, Jin-wook asked her. "Weren't you supposed to go to America today? Why are you still here?"

"Yeah, but it got suddenly canceled." Manager Choi replied.

"Cancelled?! Why?" He was taken aback.

"I'm not sure. I think they had an argument. he told me not to let her out of the house for a while."

An argument, for what reason? Jin-wook made a mental note to ask Samuel about it as he entered the assistant's office. when he spotted him, Manager Lee sent him a desperate signal for help.

Something's up. Jin-wook gently knocked and entered the director's office. Samuel was going over his paperwork.

"You must have had a bit too much drink."

Samuel was hiding his face with a pair of very thick glasses, but Jin-wook was able to notice easily. In college, the two used to go to bars to drink, although he never won against Samuel in drinking games.










"I guess I lost control."

The last time he lost control so dramatically was four years ago, after confirming Hye-yeon Jin's death. But didn't he have the woman by his side right now? If he allowed her to go to America in the first place, they must've been close enough to be friends.

Samuel handed the papers to Jin-wook without adding any words.

"It's about K Pharmaceuticals. Find the bastard that vanished and deal with him firsthand. And make sure to follow me on the trip to Busan the day after tomorrow."

Normally Manager Lee joined the business trips, but from how he asked Jin-wook to go instead, this trip must be confidential.

"Is it complicated to explain?"Jin-wook asked.

"A little. Some iffy stuff in between things." Samuel impassively replied.

"How many employees would you like to bring?"

"No need for many. Two would be enough."

"Yes sir. Oh, and about the investigation on Yuri Han's father-"

"Put that on hold for now." Samuel sharply interrupted Jin-wook. He frowned and took off his glasses. Then he massaged his temples as if he had a headache.

"I beg your pardon?" Jin-wook was confused. He was the one who wanted him to dig, and yet now he seemed uninterested.

"Don't want to see for a while." He clarified.

However, the sensitive Jin-wook noticed the voice full of aching. He doesn't want to see what for a while. The research? Possibly Yuri






Han? But he knew better than to prod, the reticent man had already said too much. In the end, he just kept his silence and exited the office.

All alone in his office now, Samuel rose and walked to the window, took out a cigarette, and leaned on the sill. He didn't want to see. He didn't want to see whom? He didn't want to see. the reflection of himself in the window.

There was no denying that what he had done last night was rape. Since when did he treat women that way? The man was a ruthless, savage master, but never had he forced himself onto anyone.
Neither was he wanton nor willful when it came to women. He had always treated them in a dignified manner, else why would he be so sought after by the fairer sex despite changing partners often?

Anger and disdain culminated into self-hatred and together they devoured every iota of his being. His act was no different from that of a savage beast. abominable & heinous. No amount of self-loathing could purge his barbarism.

Truth was, he wasn't mad at the drug itself. He was mad at how she treated her body so carelessly. Like it were an object that wasn't concerned with herself. it was like she had a death wish, indulging in those medicines. But the bigger truth was, he was furious that she was ruining the body that would one day

bear his children.

Yes, that was the actual triggering factor.

It's just the way you know. I did drugs. So what? And what does that have to do with you?

There's no difference between me and that dog you stuffed by yourself! I'm not your possession!







Does it annoy you that your Barbie doll is a drug addict? Does it disgust you that you made out with such filth?




Yuri's dramatic reaction was shocking enough to derange Samuel. He was so exasperated that his eyes alternated between red and black. He wanted to seem like a good man, but his effort to withhold his true emotions exposed his violent streak to the maximum. In the end, the demon within had reigned over and how.



Scenes from the night inundated his senses - how Yuri turned her head away, shut her eyes allowing him to shake her body like a lifeless being. He didn't know when she had abandoned hope, but those stifled painful moans still pierced his heart.

Why had he not noticed them then? Why had he gotten carried away by the savagery?!

Pain was a byword to the pleasures that would follow. Every time they had been intimate, no matter how much time he spent in caressing and stimulating her, she would still be wreathed with pain. he didn't dare imagine how much she had suffered when he had penetrated so forcefully without care or precaution? When he had hounded and pounded her underneath. Even while trembling to her fingertips, she had not made a squeak. Except for the few errant moans when he had moved intensely, the girl seemed to have shut her lips and the world around.



Her response or lack thereof only served to infuriate him further. Had she cried out loud, screamed in pain, or even apologized, his fury wouldn't have been fueled to beyond limit, he would've even been lenient towards her. The manner in which she had withstood it all was as if it were some kind of a challenge she had no choice but to go through. Needless to say, it was the very thing that had






driven him crazy. It was as if the time they spent together was time for Yuri to patiently endure.

I'm just the worst.

The man reflected in the window bitterly admitted his sin. He inhaled deeply into his cigarette and sighed out a puff of smoke. The smoke veiled the man.








"I'm sorry. You can't leave the house for a while."

The guards had blocked Yuri's way to the airport. With bag and baggage, she stood at the door in a daze. The first-class ticket to New York City in hand became but a useless piece of trash. And as such, her sentence had begun.

Only the man knew how many days she would be spending locked within the walls of this house. In the end, she had no choice but to come up with a last-minute excuse to her uncle for her abrupt cancellation of plans.


Manager Choi could not stay still out of guilt although the situation was not her fault. But no matter how sorry she felt, there was nothing she could do. Pity the girl as she may, but the truth was she lacked all the courage to go against her master.

A lot had changed since that night. Some changes were shocking, while some expected. Sebastian had moved elsewhere. Yes, the taxidermied dog that had adorned the mantle in the living room had relinquished his abode of years giving the place a somewhat deserted feel.



The master of the house had not returned once, not even his shadow had been spotted on the premises. The clothes, shoes, and bags that were occasionally delivered had stopped too. Those were no ordinary gifts. Even Yuri, who had no interest in fashion brands, could tell they were all from the most luxurious designer brands. As such the house only had her and the servants along with Manager Choi and bodyguards.



It had been a while since she had had quiet nights especially after getting together with Samuel. Most nights she would be so spent that before she even knew it she would have slipped into a deep






slumber. She didn't prefer to sleep that way but what choice did she have in the matter. She was someone who liked her nights peaceful, perhaps 'cause she was apprehensive about the man?

Why then was she having a hard time sleeping now since she was left to her peace?

That's right, 'ever since' sleep had evaded her. She would just lay in her bed, surrounded in darkness, staring at the ceiling. letting her mind wander to where not. but sleep, she did not.

And today was no exception. After hours of turning off the lights and lying in bed, she was still fidgeting wide awake. She pressed her head onto the pillow and counted the days. One, two, three. it had already been a week now.

The first two days were absolutely intimidating. So much so that she jumped at her own shadow. She was afraid that Samuel would come back to embrace her body. violently once again. She was scared she would be pinned down again and rammed into mercilessly. She was battered and bruised, mentally and physically. and the wounds just refused to heal.



When the third day arrived, she still couldn't shake the man off her chest. His deep dark eyes, frigid voice, nonchalant visage kept haunting her, no matter how tight she closed her eyes, shut her ears. Thus, the girl was confined in a dismal dungeon that she just couldn't escape from.



The changes in her behaviour didn't go unnoticed by Manager Choi. Although she didn't know the exact situation of their relationship, she saw that Yuri was preoccupied with thoughts of Samuel day in and day out. She was an experienced lady, so although she didn't know what had transpired between the two, she still felt sympathetic towards the girl who was on house arrest







now. So, this day, she had subtly apprised her on the director's impending business trip to Busan.

He must loathe me now. He'll never look for me again. Then. what will happen to the contract? Well actually, it's good if it ends here.

A relationship with an expiration might as well let it expire early.

"Ah!"

Yuri cried out and put her hand on her forehead. She had begun to hear voices again, this happened every time she was sleep deprived. She had not slept for days together, so it was only natural to experience them now. It would begin with images constantly hounding her, followed by a voice echoing in her mind. Slowly the images would disappear, leaving behind just the voice.

She tried to block it by reading a book or watching TV, but each time she was interrupted by a constant headache. No matter what she did, she couldn't rid herself of the torture. She had lost her appetite now, eating meals were akin to a task. She carried it out mechanically, just because her body needed it.

When she held her pencil and drew to kill time, without her realizing, she would end up sketching the one face. Each time she would capture a different facade. a sober face, his angry mien. when he was focused on sex, his smile, frown. every emotion she had seen would be traced, sheet after sheet. And when she would be done, she would sit gazing at her creation for a long, long time.

A week, 7 days, 168 hours. Actually, it's been longer now?

Yuri shook, turned her head again, and thought about the meaning behind it all. Going through these motions like clockwork every day, what was the use? Where was she getting to? Her health was on a downward spiral from drug withdrawal. How much longer could she take it? Now that she wasn't getting






enough sleep, she was missing the rough sex she had with him.

She wasn't sure if she was falling asleep or losing her consciousness.

How much more devastated do you want me to feel?

The woe filled voice lingered on in her ears, tugging at her heart even now. In all honesty, she had never wanted to make him feel miserable. Instead, she was trying to conceal her own miseries from him. When he had barged in demanding an answer, she was flustered and infuriated that her most embarrassing secret had been exposed. She was desperately fumbling to cover it up and chose defiance as her shield. The truth was murky, she unkempt-how could she strip herself before him?



Funny how she wanted to appear flawless before him like something one can never achieve no matter how hard and badly one wanted it. Something that stayed in the heart, like a dream or an illusion. Just like how he was to her.

In the end, Samuel had shattered her dream to pieces, shredded the fantasy, and abruptly pulled her back to reality.

When the ringing in her ears became louder, she frantically got up from the bed. There was no way she could go to sleep tonight. She hurriedly went down to the basement, perhaps the aimless doodling would bring her some respite. If not, the ringing was sure to drive her insane.



Inexplicably, the scent of the paint and wood in the basement studio soothed her taut nerves. Yuri took a deep gulp of air, turned on the lights, and started sifting through her sketchbook. Right then, a small envelope fell to the ground from between the pages. It was something that was mixed with gifts from Samuel.









As soon as she caught sight of the envelope, Yuri instinctively knew it's the same thing from last time. She could ask Manager Choi to get rid of it but she let it stay. Maybe she wanted to remind herself that the two might be playing a couple, but in fact, their relationship was nothing more than a passing affair. No matter how pitiful it was to think about it, it was still true.



Yuri debated on whether she should open the envelope or not. As she fiddled with it, she could feel the contents, it seemed like there were photographs inside. Whoever had sent it, seemed to have a penchant for sending photos, this was the second time she was receiving one.



She had a feeling, just like last time, these photos would bring her no good. Thinking up to her, she casually ripped it open but what greeted her was beyond her imagination. she screamed her guts out.


"Wha-What is this?!"




As the stack of photos slipped from her trembling hands and scattered on the floor, the ghastliness of it lay bare. Most of them were shots of a man and a woman. They appeared to be on a date like a normal couple, except for the fact that the red lines across the woman's face made them extremely grotesque. They were all photos of herself and Samuel in Jinseong.

Ho- how. Why would anybody.?

One by one her gaze rested on the photos on the floor, each was eerier than the one before. However, her pupils widened when she noticed one particular photo. It was during her high school graduation, she and Hye-yeon were standing next to each other with their graduation caps on. Yuri looked at her young face.

<The Whore who Killed her Friend!>

"OH GOOOODDD!"

She shrieked at the offensively squiggled scarlet handwriting. She could feel a thin barrier in her head crack as she lost control of her emotions. It was frightening. Too frightening for her to handle. Her attention was drawn to her deathly silent surroundings. She was used to this creepy aura. It was happening again. She was being sucked into her thoughts as her emotions engorged and exploded.

Yuri hastily picked up the photos and ran to the library. She nervously bit on her nails as her quaking fingers inserted them into the shredder. Perhaps because the ambience was shrouded in pin-drop silence, the shredder's soft chomping felt especially loud.

As she stood there looking at the pictures going through the blades, she felt a sudden splitting pain in her head like it was her and not the pictures that were in the shredder right now. It hurt, it








hurt her so much. Her hands instinctively started looking for medication, at least her sleeping pill.

As if stimulated by the groping fingers, a spark of memory jolted her awake. Back when she had just moved into the house, she had trouble sleeping at night. When she stayed awake for three days straight, Samuel had reluctantly handed her sleeping pills. She clearly remembered they were on the shelf. Since nothing was touched in this empty house, the pills should still be there. Yuri impatiently opened the shelf.




The car had just passed the tollgate to Seoul. Four hours had passed since they had left for Busan. Jin-wook checked on Samuel through the rearview mirror. The man had drunk quite a lot in the last dinner meeting. Actually, he drank a lot during the whole 3-day trip but not to the point that it would affect his work. Even so, Jin-wook decided to stay vigilant in case the man might act out strangely.



"Where would you like to go?"

Eyes shut, Samuel rolled his body into a ball in the backseat. He didn't reply. He must still be drunk.

"Let's go home," Jin-wook said, still keeping an eye on the rear seat.



Samuel slowly opened his eyes, he must not have been asleep.

"Home?" He mumbled.

Jin-wook replied with a brief 'yes' and without waiting for an answer switched directions.









Ever since childhood, Samuel referred to the house in which he lived with his grandfather as the 'main house'. The only place he called 'home' was the house in which he stayed with Yuri Han.

When they entered the neighbourhood, Samuel ordered Jin-wook to park the car in front of the house. It was past midnight, the street had returned to tranquility. There was not a single drunk trooping around this safe neighbourhood.

The team of security guards outside the house greeted Samuel politely. Against everyone's expectation, the boss did not get out of the car. Instead, he took out a cigarette and sat there quietly.

Jin-wook rolled down the backseat window half-way. The night breeze was cold as ever but quite potent to recover from a hangover. The white smoke melted into the darkness. Samuel looked up at the house and took a deep puff. Jin-wook simply let him be.



He finally spoke up as he bit onto his second cigarette. "Reminds me of the past."

"When do you mean?"

"When Hye-yeon Jin- I mean- Yuri Han went missing."

He was saying things he normally would keep to himself. He must still be drunk. Jin-wook silently kept listening.

As for the inebriated man, he ignored the other's lack of reaction and kept talking slowly. "Before I even notice it, I always end up in front of this house. Just like now."

Jin-wook met eyes with Samuel through the rearview mirror. When it came to himself, Samuel was extremely strict. He usually slept for two to three hours only, stayed up all night at work, never took a vacation like his peers, at least not to exotic locations. These were






Director Seo's famous characteristics, a thorough workaholic was what the world viewed him as.

Guess it wasn't true tonight for Samuel, a cigarette between his fingers, whiled away his time doing nothing but gazing at the house ahead that had not a single light turned on. He seemed too afraid to enter the house that was wreathed in his marks.

As if aware of the outside situation, a light was turned on in the house. Samuel's eyes followed the light.

". It's by the library. What time is it?"

"It has just turned 3 AM. "

He frowned. "I guess she can't sleep." His murmur showed a hint of affection.

Jin-wook carefully asked him. "Aren't you going in?"

Samuel was at a loss for words for a minute. "No. Not today. I can't."

He rolled up the windows and leaned his head on the back seat.

"Let's go to the main house." When Samuel felt the movement of the car, he closed his eyes.

You don't listen to me when I don't give you consent. Do you even consider me as a human being?

I'm not your possession!

It was not like he wasn't tempted to go into the house, he did long to see her. But when her cries came rushing back to him, he turned numb. How much pain she must have been in. how savagely he








had hurt her, damaged her body. How selfish he had been. No, he didn't want to repeat the mistake.

Only he knew the kind of willpower he had to muster to rein in his impatience, change the destination of the car, and arduously try to eliminate any thoughts of going to her.








"Good morning."

The next day Samuel had just finished a lonesome breakfast when Jin-wook appeared in the dining hall. The man ordered a small coffee, which was a clear indication that he was done with his meal.


"You must have slept here." Samuel rose from his seat.

"Yes. I woke up early to play chess with the CEO." Jin-wook answered.

After he had brought the Samuel over last night, he had stayed back. Among other reasons, he wanted to be sure his friend cum boss was fine.

"That's good to hear. He refuses to play with me."

"He complains how he beats you too easily and how it gets too boring." Jin-wook replied with a smile.

Samuel shrugged. "There's no reason to win."

That meant, if there was a reason to win, he would have easily won. He was a man driven with purpose even in trifling matters, so where he didn't see one he wouldn't waste his time.

Samuel requested his coffee to be delivered to the library as he walked out of the door. Other than a brief meeting with a foreign buyer in the afternoon, he was free for the rest of the day. It was time to deal with the very thing he had been procrastinating on for a while- Yuri Han. It was his guilt all along that was hindering him from tending to the problems around her, but he knew he couldn't delay it any longer.









When Jin-wook stepped out to take a call from family, Samuel called Jin-ho.

"Look up all the available hospitals. This needs to be kept a secret to the public." He was never the one for civilities, always getting straight to the point in a terse tone.

Seoin Hospital, under the Seoin Group, was renowned for its adept surgeries and state-of-the-art facilities. The only downside was that it did not have a separate rehab clinic as such. So, anyone with access to the hospital would be privy to every patient's history. Samuel liked to keep his private matters private, even from his family. This included Yuri and especially her condition.

Jin-ho cautiously asked Samuel.

"Is it true that she did drugs?"

"Yes."

"Since when?"

"Probably back in America. It's a place full of temptations, and her job's particularly exposed to it too."

Every night in towns such as Soho or Greenwich Village in New York, folks who called themselves "artists" emerged to seek drugs.

She must also have started out of curiosity. Samuel did not want to think too much about it.

o	"I heard there's a helpful clinic in the countryside. The son of S is also a regular there.."

"No. I want it to be as close as possible."

She needed treatment without the public's attention, but he wanted her to stay by his side. She had to be by his side.






"How long does the treatment take?"

"It's very difficult to make a conclusion. The controlled substance was strong, but the antidepressive ingredient was also abusive. It was a miracle that the airport let these go. This could last long term."


Samuel lit his cigarette. So far, his effort to cut on cigarettes had turned to naught. He wished for a child. But the woman in his arms was like an illusion that would disappear any moment. He especially wished to see Yuri bear his children and give birth to babies that resembled her.



"Nothing seems to go right." Samuel swallowed his murmur with the cigarette smoke.

That's when Jin-wook returned from his phone call. He gave a detailed report as he repeated what he had heard from the ex-hotel manager the other night.

"So what does that man want in exchange?" Samuel snickered. If that man harboured thoughts of blackmailing him, then even the heavens wouldn't be able to save him.

"He wants a new position that works indoors instead of the parking lot." Jin-wook was only the messenger, whether or not the man would have his wish granted depended on this almighty devil before him.


"Let him do as he wants." Came the reply.

Jin-wook immediately got the gist of the words and said, "I'll head to Jinseong this afternoon to get the video footage."

"Is there anyone else who knows about the incident?"










Since the location was the hotel lobby, chances were more than one person knew of this. This was why Jin-wook had asked the same question to the man, besides, it also served as a good source to double-check should that man be sending them on a wild goose chase.



"Hyeon-ah Kim was in the lobby that day. She would know exactly what happened."

Hyeon-ah Kim. A charismatic face instantly appeared in his mind, the kind that made it obvious that she was not an easy person to handle.


"Did you find out about him?"

The 'him' here was the driver involved in the accident who had been released from prison two years ago. Since the cameras had all been cut off, he was the next best bet to get answers.

"Yes. Only a short while after his release, he opened a restaurant that's pretty big in his hometown. It's quite confusing. How did a man who was bankrupt prior to the accident obtain the money to open a restaurant?"


"Worth finding out."

Samuel crossed his arms and mulled the info to complete the puzzle. President Jin and In-bae Lee. What sort of thing would involve both of these individuals? Despite the significant hints, the truth had yet to reveal itself.

A call from Manager Choi broke the silence. Must be about Yuri if she's calling this early in the morning.

"What's the matter?"










"Sir, the main door is not functioning properly. She must have locked it from the inside, but she isn't responding to the doorbell."




The entrance door was protected with a security function that did not allow any trespassers into the house. It could be unlocked with a passcode usually but needed a master key if someone decided to lock it from the inside. Moreover, Samuel was the only person with the master key.



He said to hold for a moment and ended the call. Something did not seem right. He quickly got up and looked at Jin-wook.

"I must go see Yuri."

He called Yuri during his entire ride to the house. No matter how long he tried he was not connected to her. Was she sleeping

in? His watch indicated that it was past 10 AM. She did not seem to be able to sleep last night, was this why?

He tried to stay nonchalant but his anxiety only intensified with each passing moment. Jin-wook noticed Samuel's nervous face through the rearview mirror.

"You saw her awake very late at night just yesterday." He tried to remind him, in case he didn't remember because he was quite drunk.


Correct. He'd checked with his own eyes that the library had its lights turned on late at night. But he was still anxious. And what was he excessively fretting over? That Yuri might have disappeared just like in the past. His heart pounded vigorously from nervousness, his face was ashen.

Samuel firmly pursed his lips as he sank in his thoughts. The moment they arrived, he did not even give time for Jin-wook to park the car before he dashed out of the vehicle and to the house.








Manager Choi and the security guards, who were standing by the entrance, lowered their heads.

"Still no response from the inside?"

"No. I rang the doorbell a few times, but she wouldn't answer. "

Samuel pulled out the master key and unlocked the secured door.

Like mad, he sprinted upstairs and burst open Yuri's bedroom door.

The room felt eerily dark, what with its closed curtains and stuffy air. He quickly turned on the lights but saw not a soul.

Where is she?

He rushed to his bedroom, pushing the door open. As he stood there taking in the scene, he noticed a silhouette of a body covered with a blanket all the way to the face. It was a habit of hers to cover her face when she slept. When he caught sight of her hair and fingers peeking out and stroked his chest in a bid to calm his throbbing heart.



"Yuri."

As he cautiously stepped inside, the sleeping figure should've provided him a semblance of relief. Yet, his heart never ceased to race. He curled his nose at the thick stench of alcohol permeating the room. Did she drink? About then, he stepped on something and came to a halt.



He narrowed his eyes at the familiar object that he had accidentally kicked- a bottle of Booker's. This was a whiskey of over 60% alcohol concentration that was gracing the shelf in his library. Only now it was absolutely empty.

Did. did she finish this bottle by herself?










Samuel stilled before panic took over through and through. If this weak woman drank this much alcohol, she must be under the risk of acute alcohol intoxication!

Hurriedly, he tugged at the blanket veiling Yuri from head to toe. The anxiety in his voice was a testament to the turmoil of his heart at the moment.

"Yuri!" He cried aloud, hoping to wake her up.

Soon the wan face of the slumbering girl revealed from under. She lay there, dyed in a shade of blue. lifeless.

He held her by the shoulders and frantically shook her as he shouted: "Yuri Han! Wake up!"

By now, startled by the racket, Jin-wook and Manager Choi had rushed into the room.

A distraught Samuel lifted the limp girl up, her body cold. A stunned Jin-wook quickly recomposed himself as he placed his fingers on her neck. Her pulse was barely perceptible.

"Call the ambulance now!" Samuel screamed. He could feel his whole body fluster. His hands vigorously rubbed over Yuri's feet and hands, trying to induce some heat. It was the most he could do to help her keep breathing.

"What happened?" Jin-wook took out the flashlight he always carried around to check on Yuri's pupils.

Samuel shook his head. "I can't be certain, but I should say it's acute alcohol intoxication-" He paused in the midst of speaking as a silhouette of a white object on the side table grasped his attention.


It can't be!






Samuel ordered Jin-wook to look over Yuri as he picked up the object. It was a vial of sleeping pills. The pills Jin-ho prescribed to him a while back. When he opened the lid, he was thunderstruck.

The vial was. empty.




His hands trembled, Jin-ho took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He frowned at the moist sensation. He had to give up on pursuing a career in general surgery because of his inherent personality, despite getting perfect grades in school.

Doctors are expected to be inherently composed, no matter the situation adn it is especially true for surgeons. Given that, this talent medico was a contrast to his profession. He was easily overwhelmed during an emergency, losing his cool and bathing in perspiration. Every time he recalled the criticisms a professor had once showered him with, he felt bitter all over.

Save her, do whatever it takes to save her!

Samuel's desperate cry was alarming enough to make the emergency assistants and even the vice president rush over to him. Jin-ho had never seen this Seo Scion this enraged ever since befriending him. The cardiologist was also more sincere than usual as he examined the D. I (Drug Intoxication) patient meticulously.

God was on their side. The sleeping pills Jin-ho had prescribed Samuel were not that potent. Moreover, they had expired over three years ago, so the ingredients were no longer as active. One more thing they were lucky with was the fact that Yuri did not take all at once but in gaps as she gradually consumed them.

However, this did not mean that the situation was not dire. She had consumed over half a bottle of pills with a full bottle of whiskey, she would've been in fighting for life had they arrived any later.






They opened her mouth to force her to throw up and cleanse her stomach. Samuel clenched his fist the whole time he watched this process. Sucking out the drug was incomparably more painful than taking the drug. As her ferocious squirms of pain rang through the room, his fist turned white, trembling in trepidation.

A prudent Jin-wook was quick to caution the hospital staff about divulging info, the matter had to be kept under wraps at all costs.

The emergency procedure was completed and Yuri was wheeled out to another room, even then Samuel's firmly clenched fists didn't relax.


Seeing the man's stance, Jin-ho thought the actual one at risk was Samuel, not Yuri. He was pointlessly wandering around the pale woman like a ghost. The phone rang several more times but he did not even flinch.


Right then, Jin-wook ran to his boss in a frenzy and whispered. There seemed to be an emergency at work. It was only now that Samuel reluctantly recovered his sanity and took his eyes off the woman.


When he left, Jin-ho felt a humongous burden lift off his shoulders. Their treatment was a success, the woman would soon wake up and have no trouble recovering. Then, Samuel would also be relieved. At least that was what he thought until-

"Aaahh! No! Don't, don't put it inside me!"

Who would have thought that a completely unconscious woman would have a seizure?





As soon as she opened her eyes, she yanked on her cannula. The force backfired, the needle poked her vein, blood gushed out. Her frail hand was dyed crimson in no time.

A panic-stricken Jin-ho yelled for the nurses. Since Yuri had only just been purged of alcohol and toxins, even slight bleeding was extremely detrimental, it could even harm the heart. Time was of the essence, the nurses held her hands, stopping her from moving about, as the doctor instantly grabbed a vile of tranquilizer and held up the syringe. At the sight of the needle, the terrified and agitated girl's eyes glistened, so much that the man holding it turned anxious.



"No, no, no, no needles, please no!"

Her ear-piercing shriek stunned the nurses, but the seasoned staff only gripped her firmly. But a frenetic Yuri would have none of it, tugging her hand to wrest free, shoving the vital sign monitor, and pushing Jin-ho away. Her skinny body was so potent that the nurses struggled to calm her down.

After a long hustle, the nurses were ultimately able to subdue her, pinning her onto the bed. With super speed, Jin-ho quickly injected the ready syringe into her vein. She shook her head in rejection, as she burst into tears.

"Please, please stop, please-"

The drug took immediate effect, her wails eventually died down, and she closed her eyes seemingly at peace. Her limp body looked even more fragile as if it would shatter with just a light breeze.

Jin-ho let out a deep sigh as if he had just won an arduous battle. He then asked the nurses to tidy up the chaotic room.






"Wha-what is this overreaction~" Jin-ho murmured to himself as he sank his face in his palms. The fear, hatred, fury, and instability reflected in the woman's eyes at the sight of the needle was too stressful even in hindsight. As a doctor had seen his fair share of people with a fear of needles, but this girl's was beyond extreme.

Jin-ho pulled up his glasses and exhaled audibly. He gazed at the wan form on the bed, monitoring her diligently. He couldn't afford a lapse of judgment at this stage, not just because he feared Samuel's demonic aura, but also because he was a sincere doctor.

After some waiting, with his heart in his mouth, the vital signs gradually turned stable again. It was only now that he noticed how bony Yuri's arm was. Because of this, they had to administer the intravenous through her hand instead of the wrist.



"What's wrong with her wrist?"

When Jin-ho came back after discussing some matters regarding Yuri with the vice president, Samuel was already back in the room. Did he deal with that mandatory meeting well before he came back here so quickly?


Samuel had long noticed the doctor's arrival but still locked his eyes on the pale woman.

"She had a seizure in the middle."

"A seizure?" He turned his body in surprise.

Jin-ho was intimidated by Samuel's expression. The man who was always apathetic portrayed a strong feeling of concern on his face.


"?She's mentally very unstable. Did something happen?"







Samuel did not reply instead turned his head towards Yuri again. Jin-ho could sense an aura of both fury and ambivalence from the man. Was he furious because he was ambivalent, or was he ambivalent because he was furious? The emotions behind his straight facade seemed to be boiling wildly inside him.

"Leave, I want some peace." He sounded hostile but also sincere.

Jin-ho thought it best not to provoke the man and quietly left the room. It was the only room in the VIP area so things were super quiet here. As he stepped out, he found Jin-wook waiting for him in the hallway. He beckoned the doctor.

"Bro."

This was how Jin-ho usually called Jin-wook. Because of their age gap, Jin-wook seemed more like a father than a brother to the other. Well, he did take care of him instead of their deceased parents, so it was reasonable to think that way.

"How's the condition?" he asked solemnly.

"Who are we talking about? Samuel or the girl?" Jin-wook replied gravely.

"The girl."

"We've detoxified the drug. She had a seizure in the middle of it, but she's doing much better now. Her health has overall weakened. She needs more examinations done."

"She had a seizure?" Jin-wook was surprised.

"She went berserk at the sight of the needle. I'm not a psychology major, but I assume it's a typical reaction of PTSD patients. It was serious actually. I think it's due to her memory loss. You had a hard time from it back in the day too. You even had to quit your job as a






police officer." The man reminded his older brother as he gazed at him and let out a sigh.
